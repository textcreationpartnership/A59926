         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>WHereas our former whole Work of this Nature (as we ſaid) is now by Divine diſpoſal become a very Uſeful Commentary to Explain, Confirm, and Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> what of theſe Divine Myſteries is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained or briefly couched in our two laſt Tracts on <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.5. of the Saints bodily Reſurrection, whereby they will be made capable of the happineſs of Chriſts <hi>Davidical</hi> Kingdome, and alſo in this Tract upon <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.5. which ſets forth the particularities making up the happineſs thereof: It being the main ſcope of all Revelation Propheſie (after the ſuffering times of the Church are over) to point out in their due order the fulfillings of the moſt antient Promiſes and Covenants made to and with the faithful Fore-fathers, for themſelves and their Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Seed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then to take place; being (as we obſerved formerly) that excellent uſe of our Saviours ſaid Divine Key in the four laſt Chapters of this Book: Wherefore we prefixed to the former Tract, our <hi>Compriſal</hi> and <hi>Syſtem,</hi> to illuſtrate theſe matters, with the Picture of the ſaid Divine Key, <hi>p.</hi> 63, &amp; 64. of the ſame, which are alſo as much to be looked to in this, becauſe they both ſtand upon the ſame Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations (as we hope ſound and judicious Chriſtians will be much by this Tract helped farther to diſcern) for Divine Goſpel Truths of this nature are not ſlightly to be paſſed over, but ſeriouſly pondered by all ſuch, as containing now in theſe times more Mercy &amp; Divine Grace in them than the world is aware of; becauſe they have been formerly leſs diſcovered, and their times more remote, but are now neer approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (as we hope to many ſuch may hereby be made manifeſt) <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>Now that our former ſaid whole work may be really found thereunto more ſubſervient, we ſhall here add unto the ſaid Compriſal of the ſame work, ſomewhat more particularly to point out what therein ſerves chiefly, 1. For Explication. 2. For Confirmation. 3. For Illuſtration and Application.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:42450:5"/> 1. For Explication chiefly ſerve, our Key by many Diſtinctions, and ſhort Aſſertions referring to many parts thereof, with the Account next following, and all Summaries of theſe Dectrines, as the Letter of <hi>Nov.</hi> 3.63. in the <hi>Prodr.</hi> with 16 Divine Theſes in the <hi>Iren</hi> and the Addition there, to which belongs the Treatiſe on <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. alſo the two Folded Leaves at the end thereof, and all other Letters and Papers in the <hi>Prodr.</hi> which with the Scheme thereof and Parallels, give much light to the Book of <hi>Revelation,</hi> and alſo what in the <hi>Irenicon</hi> is ſaid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the 4, &amp; 5, <hi>ch.</hi> which conſidered with the Book of Parallels of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> and the <hi>Revelation</hi> do jointly give the greateſt light to regulate mens minds in theſe Myſteries, and from whence (amongſt many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers) the ſtrongeſt Confirmations may be drawn, (as in part was ſhewed in our Account) and the want of ſome competent light therein makes ſome perſons ſtrangly averſe from ſuch Truths, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe (I believe) would not be ſo, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And alſo for Explication much ſerve the 31. Uſeful Obſervations after the Tract on <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.20. whereby may be obſerved how the Spirit of God hath Divinely couch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed matters of this nature in holy Scripture, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with other things fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing: Alſo the Paper of the Jews and Iſraelites great Reſtauration, Printed <hi>May</hi> 1.74. and much alſo for Explication ſerve the three for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Practicals upon 1. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.20. the ground whereof, See Aſſert. 6. of our Key, and of <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. in the 17th Aſſert. and upon <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.17. the ground of which is from the 14th Aſſertion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For Confirmation chiefly ſerve firſt the ſeven Foundations in the Contents of the <hi>Ireni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> and in the two firſt leaves of the <hi>Abridgment</hi> of the ſame, alſo that happy and glorious ſtate of Chriſts ſaid Kingdome is confirmed by the 12 Foundations of the Faith thereof from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Holy Scriptures to the end: which is alſo farther again con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in many particularities thereof in the 8 Convincing Arguments in the Word written, occaſionally drawn up.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe the Holy Scripture ſets down many things to be at the beginning, and in the time, and after the end of the ſaid thouſand years Reign of Chriſt with his Saints: of which, 36. Particulars are ſpecified, Arg. 1.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe many ſuch things in the Old Teſtament reſpecting the ſame time and ſtate are by Chriſt and his Apoſtles ſo explained in the New Teſtament.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Becauſe thoſe times and things belonging to them are ſo ſtamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and marked out by the Spirit of God in the Old Teſtament, which have alſo their Explications and Confirmations in the New Teſtament, reſpecting the ſame times and things.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:42450:5"/> 4. Becauſe concerning them both the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> divinely teacheth us, <hi>Acts</hi> 3.20, 21. <hi>[That God hath ſpoken by the mouth of all his holy Prophets ſince the world began]</hi> which is largely proved <hi>ch.</hi> 5, 6, 7, 8, &amp;c. of the <hi>Irenicon,</hi> which Teſtimonies are again quoted in the Treatiſe on <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Becauſe they are eſpecially confirmed by the double Teſtimonie of <hi>Daniel,</hi> and the <hi>Revelation,</hi> as is abundantly manifeſt by the Paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lels of both Books.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Not here to mention any more: Becauſe Chriſt hath encouraged all his Overcomers in all the ſuffering times <hi>[until the ſaid happy peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful times ſhall come]</hi> with many ſpecial Promiſes of things to be enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by them in the ſaid ſtate, as by the 7th Argument is manifeſt.</p>
               <p>All which Grounds and Arguments may be abundantly ſufficient to all ſuch unto whom God ſhall give Faith to believe them: but in the mean time, thoſe that do not, or will not, cannot be able to over-throw the ſtrength of them: But I hope ſerious and judicious Chriſtians will upon due and impartial conſideration of them, judge them too weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to be neglected or diſregarded.</p>
               <p n="3">3. For Illuſtration and Application of theſe Doctrines all the 5 ſaid Practicals on ſeveral Subjects and Texts, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.20. <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.17. with theſe two laſt alſo on <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.5. &amp; <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.5. may ſufficiently and aptly ſerve, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and do not only much illuſtrate the Doctrines of the ſaid ſtate and times, but point out many excellent Uſes of them.</p>
               <p>It may here (haply) be advantagious to ſome to hint at leaſt in what way God hath been graciouſly pleaſed to lead us to theſe laſt great Diſcoveries in theſe two laſt Treatiſes, as firſt by two Principles laid by a Reverend and truly Religious Perſon, Mr. <hi>H. P.</hi> then my Tutor, when I was about 20 years of age, who was much owned and honored in his time, <hi>&amp;c. viz.</hi> Firſt, That many great Promiſes, ſuch as <hi>Eſ.</hi> 60. &amp; others like, were neither yet fulfilled, nor were to be interpreted only in a ſpiritual ſence, but would be litterally fulfilled in their time. Secondly, By informing me of what Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> had then lately written, on <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. to be in the 1000 years which was owned in the Primitive times, which occaſioned me to look into things of that nature divers years following; but about 30 years after, when I had left the Univerſity, I was ſo taken up in the work of my Miniſtry, and eſpecially in the latter part thereof, in Preaching, Expounding, Catechiſing, publick Faſts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo that all that time I had little freedome for ſuch an intenſe buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, when by a double neceſſity, I being very much then ſpent, was
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:42450:6"/>then laid aſide: But in that my Retirement I began again to reaſſume my former notions, and perſue them, about <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 1662.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By that Eſſay in my <hi>Irenicon,</hi> to prove that ſuch a Kingdom of Chriſt would be, from the ſeven Foundations therein, in that method ſet down <hi>ch.</hi> 1. which was after altered by the diſcovering that Chriſts Reign being in the great day of Judgment would be perſonal, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For in ſearching ſuch Myſteries it was hard to keep any ſet Method then and all parts after were occaſional, not firſt intended: to which I firſt added thoſe occaſional Letters and Papers in the <hi>Prodromus,</hi> to give light to the order of Revelation Propheſie; to ſupply the want of which and of the Abridgment of the <hi>Rev.</hi> on <hi>ch.</hi> 5. in the <hi>Irenic.</hi> we framed the Scheme of the whole <hi>Rev.</hi> and Summary of <hi>Dan.</hi> in one ſheet, of very great uſe, when many hundred of both, <hi>Prod.</hi> and <hi>Irenic.</hi> were burnt, <hi>An. Dom.</hi> 1666. and of the <hi>Parallels,</hi> from which, with the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridgment of <hi>Daniel,</hi> was the Book of <hi>Parallels</hi> framed, ſuiting to the 5th <hi>ch.</hi> of the <hi>Irenicon,</hi> which I found to be of exceeding great uſe both to ground and regulate all ſuch ſtudies ever ſince: After theſe I was divers years ſtopped in my proceeding by the loſs of two Coppies of the two firſt Practicals on <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. &amp; <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.20. until I was forced by an unexpected Law-ſute to continue ſome time in <hi>London,</hi> about <hi>An. Dom.</hi> 70. I then again (as I had formerly) found ſo much encouragement and engagement, both from God, and many Honorable, Learned, Religious and Worthy Perſons of ſeveral Ranks and Conditions, to proceed in theſe Studies, that thereupon I drew up the 12 ſaid foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Faith, and publiſhed the ſame, with the ſaid 8 Convincing Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, containing the ſubſtance of the chief Argumentative parts of all the former: Unto which, the Tract on <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.17. was added, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain the Diſtinction from Scripture of the two <hi>New Jeruſalems,</hi> or the two fold ſtate of <hi>New Jeruſalem</hi> then for the raiſed, and then converted Saints of one happy Communion, on <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. gloriouſly deſcribed the Great, Holy, and Beloved <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. <hi>God is the Maker and Builder of,</hi> which hath Foundations, upon its Inhabitants coming down from God out of Heaven, which will by the immediate hand of God be made for the Fore-fathers then which <hi>Abraham</hi> expected, and for all that die in the Faith till Chriſts ſecond coming without ſin to Salvation, <hi>v.</hi> 10, 16, 39, 40. Secondly, The other, that <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to be built by men, whoſe Walls Strangers and their Kings, ſaith the Prophet <hi>Eſay,</hi> ſhall build, (probably) that deſcribed in the 9 laſt <hi>ch.</hi> of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> for the then Converted and Reduced <hi>Jews,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:42450:6"/>Iſraelites</hi> and Gentiles coming in, in the natural life, which <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. are called the Nations of them that are ſaved, walking in the light of the other ſaid great, holy, and beloved new Jeruſalem: wherein are thoſe fifteen well-approved Reaſons, why it will be then in the world ſuited wonderfully to the condition of the then raiſed Saints.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, from thoſe gradual Diſcoveries in all the other parts and parcels by the ſuperaboundant Grace of God to ſo weak and unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy an Inſtrument, we more lately obtained that great Diſcovery of the main Scope of all Revelation-Propheſie, in the 4 laſt Chapters of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> as the Divine Key left by Jeſus Chriſt for his Church, opening that ſtate of the 1000 years, to be the fulfilling of the moſt antient Promiſes, Mercies, and Covenants made to the faithful Fathers and their ſpiritual Seed, then in both their ſaid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which we have here, according to Grace received, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured further to open and explain in this laſt Treatiſe alſo: com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending the ſame with all the former in our Prayers to his bleſſing for the benefit of all true Believers, who only have intereſt in all Goſpel-conſolations, whether laid down in Holy Scriptures more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently or more myſteriouſly, whoſe Servant I more eſpecially pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs my ſelf to be in this their ſo great concernment, and of the Great Lord and Maſter of us all, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

               <p>WE now being to conſider in our preſent proceeding, that great, gracious, and glorious work of God's renovation of all things in reference to the ſaid Kingdom of Chriſt to fill up thoſe times reſerved for thoſe mercies belonging to that ſtate and world. We ſhall ſtill therefore refer the Reader to the ſerious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſal of our ſaid Compriſal and Syſtem in reference to this alſo, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Subject ſtanding upon the ſame foundations (as was ſaid,)
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:42450:7"/>The Declaration whereof is ſo gloriouſly illuſtrated by him that is ſaid to ſit upon the Throne, as in the Text.</p>
               <p>As our bleſſed Saviour did firſt in his life-time doctrinally teach many things concerning that ſtate and world, which <hi>the children of the Reſurrection ſhould then be counted worthy of</hi> (as we ſhewed from <hi>Luke</hi> 20.35, 36.) and afterwards very punctually explained his ſaid Doctrine in many particulars in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> reſpecting the ſame in the order of accompliſhment.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Even ſo the Spirit of God guided the Apoſtle <hi>Peter, Acts</hi> 3.19, 20, 21. to teach divers things concerning <hi>the times of reſtitution of all things,</hi> which our Saviour here hath as punctually in this <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation</hi> of the renovation of all things alſo explained, concerning that time in the order of accompliſhment; when God (as in this Text) will <hi>make all things new;</hi> for all the links in the Chain of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation</hi>-Propheſies have their unalterable meaſures of their propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned times, many ways through Divine wiſdom and goodneſs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated to the beneſit &amp; happineſs of the Church of Chriſt in the world, until all promiſed mercies be fully performed in the iſſue: Wherefore ſo much reference is made to the Prophets to the end of that Divine Book, as is very obſervable.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> particularly teacheth, <hi>that the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens muſt receive Chriſt until thoſe times of reſtitution of all things.</hi> So Chriſt in the <hi>Revelation</hi> order placeth thoſe times upon his own coming from the right hand of his Father to deſtroy the Beaſt and falſe Prophet, and of the Reſurrection of the ſaid Saints to reign with him, <hi>Chap.</hi> 19. <hi>&amp;</hi> 20.</p>
               <p n="3">3. As the ſame Apoſtle informs us further, that God hath ſpoken of theſe times, not things (as <hi>Beza</hi> well notes on that Text) <hi>by the mouth of all his holy Prophets ſince the world began:</hi> So here the Prophets are not only referred unto, and often mentioned upon theſe accounts, but the particulars are therefore many times aſſerted to be true and faithful, as being before foretold or promiſed in the Writings of the Prophets.</p>
               <p n="4">4. As the ſaid Apoſtle uſeth that expreſſion of them <gap reason="foreign">

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> It is true, that <hi>Ch.</hi> 20.4. ſpeaks only of two ſorts of Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on-Martyrs, as was anſwered to the <hi>cry of thoſe Souls under the Altar,</hi> Rev. 6.10. to whom it was ſaid, that they <hi>ſhould reſt till their fellow-ſervants and brethren ſhould be killed:</hi> the Souls are there ſaid to be <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, of ſuch as were before beheaded under the red Dragon in the Pagan Perſecutions of the Sts. but thoſe that were called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the fellow-ſervants &amp; Brethren after to be killed, were ſuch as ſuffer'd ſince under the Beaſt, as <hi>Ch.</hi> 20.4. deſcribes them; of which, though very many ſuffered death, yet not all: neither are they only Martyrs of Chriſt that ſuffer death actually, but all ſuch as have had a willingneſs and reſolution of mind to ſuffer for Chriſt, if called to it, are reckoned by him for Martyrs; and though others have ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a leſs degree than death, yet are alſo to be counted ſuch. We know <hi>Iſhmael</hi>'s mocking of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> is called Perſecution by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle; and all the Saints have ſuffered one way or other for God and Chriſt; for which cauſe they are all to be eſteemed Martyr, as they have been ſufferers under the Beaſt, or under any other Perſecutors in any times before, &amp; that all ſuffering Sts. deceaſed before the time of the Beaſt ſhall alſo riſe at the firſt ſaid Reſurrect. of the juſt, when both the Martyrs blood will be avenged, as <hi>Deut.</hi> 33.42, 43. and they all rewarded, as may from theſe following conſiderations be made to appear.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:42450:8"/> 1. Becauſe when Chriſt comes he will come with all ſuch his ſaid Saints, whether they have actually ſuffered death for him, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks expreſly 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.13. with <hi>Zech.</hi> 14.5. <hi>He comes with all his Saints.</hi> And again, ſaith he, <hi>All that then ſleep in Jeſus, will God bring with him,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.14. namely, to raiſe their bodies from the dead: the Scripture then is clear for the reſurrection of all then.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That parallel Text, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.18. that reſpects the time and occaſion of judging the Saints, <hi>viz.</hi> with a Judgment of reward or recompence at Chriſts appearance, makes a full enumeration of all ſorts to be then rewarded, of Old Teſtament Saints or ſufferers, as well as of the New; yea, of all Saints in that capacity, as ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; and Prophets, as well as Apoſtles, and even all that fear Gods Name, both ſinall and great, ſhall then have their peculiar reward, though in the natural life then (which I conceive is meant of the laſt ſort of all ſuch as are ſaid to fear Gods Name:) So ſaith Chriſt then, <hi>Behold, I come quickly, and my reward is with me, to give to every one according to his works.</hi> But all deceaſed Saints are then made capable of their proper reward in that ſtate they riſe into, by the firſt bodily Reſurrection, <hi>viz.</hi> to reign with Chriſt the 1000 years in his Davidical Kingdom.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, In Chapter 21.2. When the <hi>new Jeruſalem comes down from God out of Heaven;</hi> which v. 9. is called the <hi>Lambs wife,</hi> as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining all <hi>the Spirits of juſt men made perfect</hi> upon that Reſurrection to be united to their own bodies to inhabite that City which God himſelf then makes for them, when that great Voice ſaith, <hi>Behold, the Tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them,</hi> &amp;c. Now that <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> will contain all thoſe raiſed Saints which had died be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and it will be the general priviledg of them all which God had given to Chriſt that <hi>they ſhall behold his glory which his Father hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him in his ſaid Kingdom,</hi> John 17.24.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, All Saints that have lived in ſuffering times, as all times, have been and will be from <hi>Abels</hi> death to the Saints ſaid Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; who as they have ſuffered with or for Chriſt from the world and Devil; ſo all ſuch ſufferers, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>ſhall then reign with him,</hi> 2 Tim. 2.12. and they muſt all firſt riſe bodily, before they can be capable of reigning with him in that ſtate, or of enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the promiſed mercies belonging thereunto.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, All the 24 Elders, and the four living Wights which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent the whole Church of Chriſt, Rulers and People, exult a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:42450:8"/>
                  <hi>Revel.</hi> 5.10. that in the iſſue of Revelation-propheſie, they ſhall reign upon earth, who acknowledge themſelves to be ſuch as <hi>Chriſt hath redeemed by his blood out of every kindred, tongue and people, and Nation, who ſhall have their part with Chriſt in the ſure mercies of David,</hi> according to the promiſe <hi>Eſa.</hi> 55.3. which they muſt be made capable of by the ſaid firſt Reſurrection.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, All Chriſts overcomers ſince the Revelation-propheſie began to take place in all that is ſaid there <hi>ſhortly to be done,</hi> that is in the due order of times to be accompliſhed: they are all encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged by ſomething belonging, to the <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſtate, which only by the ſaid Reſurrection they attain to their ſhares; as is particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly manifeſt in our ſeventh convincing Argument in the Word writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten: now all faithful Chriſtians are Overcomers, though they ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer not death, as thoſe ſaid Martyrs, <hi>Rev.</hi> 6.9, 10, 11. but only by leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer tryals.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, Chriſt who is appointed <hi>by the Father</hi> then <hi>to be heir of all things,</hi> promiſeth in ſpecial to each Overcomer without exception, <hi>that he ſhall alſo inherit all things with him,</hi> v. 7. which priviledg belongs to all Saints, as <hi>the Spouſe of Christ,</hi> or <hi>Lambs wife;</hi> and therefore belongs to them as Saints, to which purpoſe ſaith St. <hi>Paul, If chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, then heirs, and joynt-heirs wich Chriſt,</hi> which without the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection they cannot enjoy, no more than the ſeparate Spirits of good men enjoy them now.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>If Chriſt to the ſaid purpoſe bring all the Saints with him, to raiſe their dead bodies that they may reign with him the</hi> 1000 <hi>years, how are the reſt of the dead ſaid</hi> not to live again till the 1000 years are ended, <hi>ver.</hi> 5. <hi>are not ſome of thoſe called the reſt of the dead Saints, at leaſt, I ſay, ſome of them?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> All Saints that died in the ſuffering times before Chriſts coming, he then brings with him, to raiſe them to reign with him; but ſuch Saints as live or die afterwards, ſeem not to be in that rank or capacity; but at laſt <hi>when Chriſt deſcends with a ſhout, and the voice of an Archangel, will in a moment be rapt to meet him, and be changed with all other Saints raiſed before,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.51, 52. it is twice there aſſerted by the Apoſtle, <hi>and we ſhall all be changed;</hi> and the wicked then to be raiſed after them at the laſt Trump, ſeem to be ſome of thoſe called before the reſt of the dead <hi>that lived not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain till the</hi> 1000 <hi>years are finiſhed:</hi> and the former raiſed ſuffering Saints are many ways diſtinguiſhed in Scriptures from the other Saints. Firſt, they are expreſly termed <hi>all ſuch as ſlept in Jeſus</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:42450:9"/>that his coming, when the new <hi>Jeruſalem comes down from God out of Heaven,</hi> &amp;c. 1 <hi>Theſ</hi> 4.14. Secondly, they are diſtinguiſhed by their ſufferings for Chriſt in the former ſuffering times, upon which account they muſt reign with him (as was ſaid.) Thirdly, the Scripture de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes them by the <hi>meek</hi> that have a promiſe <hi>to inherit the earth,</hi> and delight themſelves in the abundance of peace, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37. which yet is not fulfilled, but our Saviour ſaith, ſhall be, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.5. Meek <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Abraham, Jacob, David,</hi> yea, Chriſt himſelf, and all his Martyrs ſo killed, as was ſaid, <hi>Rev.</hi> 6.10, 11. as meek Lambs were led to the ſlaughter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> who neither inherited the earth, but were pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims and ſtrangers in it; nor much leſs delighted themſelves in the abundance of peace therein, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But as for all other Saints that ſhall live in the following peaceable happy times, and all that die before the laſt Trump, and that live then, ſhall enjoy the benefit of that promiſe, who were not numbered with the former ſufferers in the ſuffering times; but yet as the Seed of <hi>Shem</hi> and <hi>Japhet,</hi> or of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> or <hi>Davids</hi> ſpiritual Seed at leaſt, if not of their natural race alſo (as many of the converted <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Iſraelites</hi> will then be) ſhall all enjoy their proper portion by promiſe and Covenant: whence the Apoſtle ſeems to call redemption of the Saints bodies (eſpecially Gentiles) <hi>the receiving of the Adoption, even the redemption of their bodies,</hi> viz. by the firſt ſaid Reſurrection, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.23. and ſuch as theſe that ſhall die in thoſe future happy peaceable times, the ſame Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſeems to intend by thoſe <hi>dead in Chriſt, that ſhall riſe firſt,</hi> 1 Theſ. 4. though in a general ſenſe it is true likewiſe of thoſe that riſe at the ſaid firſt Reſurrection: but I conceive the particular intent of that Text reſpects the later ſort of the Saints laſt raiſed at the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral rapture and change at the laſt Trump.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>But are not the Reſurrections of good and bad joyned together both in Old and New Teſtament, and both are ſaid to ariſe to Judgment, as that noted Text</hi> Dan. 12.2, 3. <hi>where</hi> ſome are ſaid to awake to life, and ſome to ſhame and everlaſting contempt; <hi>and our Saviour alſo joyns them both,</hi> John 5.29. They that have done good ſhall come forth of the Grave to the reſurrection of life, and they that have done evil to the reſurrection of Damnation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> As for <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. that ſeems particularly to reſpect the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtauration of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as appears by the end of the former Chapter, concerning <hi>Gogs</hi> the <hi>Turks</hi> deſtruction, ſpoken of alſo <hi>Ezek</hi> 38, <hi>&amp;</hi> 39. <hi>who then ſhall come to his end, &amp; none ſhall help him,</hi> when <hi>Daniels peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhall be delivered,</hi> Chap. 12.1. and ver. 2. it is only ſaid <hi>many ſhall
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:42450:9"/>then awake,</hi> viz. <hi>out of the duſt</hi> of their diſperſion and bondage, like <hi>the dry bones,</hi> Ezek. 37. but not ſaid <hi>all,</hi> which ſhould have been ſaid, if all, good and bad were to be raiſed as at a general Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection (as ſome uſe to ſpeak) and whereas that Text ſpeaks of <hi>turning many to righteouſneſs,</hi> which will not be done at any general Reſurrection, but is to be done at ſuch Civil Reſurrection of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to own a Righteouſneſs of Juſtification by faith in Chriſt which they did not before: and the <hi>wiſe</hi> that are there ſaid to do it, are in the Original ſaid to be Teachers, which cannot be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to do any ſuch thing for any upon ſuch general Reſurrection, when all time of Grace will be paſt, from the death of all that were not converted before; for, <hi>as the tree falls ſo it will lie,</hi> &amp;c. But if it were granted that this Text, and that of <hi>John</hi> 5. and many other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Texts did compriſe both firſt and ſecond Reſurrection, to the firſt and ſecond acts of both ſaid Judgments of the great day (as <hi>Jude</hi> was directed by the Spirit of God to ſtyle it) and our Saviour in a general ſenſe ſpeaks there of both; for <hi>ver.</hi> 27. he ſaith, <hi>the Father had given him Authority to execute Judgment, becauſe he is the Son of man: and as the Father gave him the Son to have life in himſelf to raiſe the dead in ſin ſpiritually,</hi> ver. 26. ſo <hi>he had power alſo hereafter to raiſe both good and bad out of the graves bodily to Judgment.</hi> For anſwer whereunto and many like paſſages in Scripture, we are to conſider that many ſuch Texts deliver only ſome general truths of the whole Doctrine delivered in this Book by our Saviour more fully and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly concerning both the ſaid Reſurrections and Judgments with what is to be known of matters to intervene betwixt both, which are always to be referred to ſuch future explications of them, as the holy Spirit hath from time to time given forth to any of Chriſts ſervants to make further known; for the Doctrines of theſe laſt things have been made known but by degrees. Of the firſt Reſurrection, <hi>Eſai.</hi> 26. ſpake darkly, ſhewing the Heathen Tyrants that oppreſſed the Jews were dead, they ſhould not live, they were deceaſed, they ſhould not riſe; <hi>ver.</hi> 14. but Gods Saints ſhould live, and with his dead body they ſhould ariſe, <hi>ver.</hi> 19. which (with other Texts in our Treatiſe on <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.5.) could not be underſtood without Chriſts Revelation of the firſt bodily Reſurrection of the Sts. there decypher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in many particulars, at what time, to what ends, how long before the reſt of the dead, as was ſhewed: and ſo for Judgment, after God had at the fall declared, <hi>the Seed of the woman</hi> [ſo to be true man, and only of the woman, and not of the man, and ſo was to
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:42450:10"/>be neceſſarily the Son of God;] that is, <hi>God to be manifeſt in the fleſh;</hi> which is the firſt part of that great Myſtery, which was 4000 years in carrying on, to lay the ſure foundation of <hi>breaking the Serpents head</hi> at his firſt coming: that by the Judgment of the great Day, he might break it 1. eminently at the firſt, and 2. totally and finally at the laſt Judgment: the next antient Propheſie for remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the power of Satan, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> was given to <hi>Enoch</hi> in the old World, recorded by <hi>Jude, ver.</hi> 13, 14. concerning Chriſts coming to Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which hath direct reference to <hi>Daniels</hi> Viſion of the firſt Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Judgment at the deſtruction of the Beaſt, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. which our Saviour confirms and explains in part, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.18. and <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. but <hi>Daniel</hi> ſpeaks not there of the laſt general Judgment, that is left for Chriſt to do, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.11. to the end 1000 years and more af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the former: and hence as <hi>Daniel</hi> of the ſaid firſt act had ſaid, <hi>The Judgment was ſet, and</hi> 2dly <hi>the books were opened:</hi> and the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> who had much of theſe myſteries revealed to him, tells us, 3. Chriſt would judge the quick, <hi>viz.</hi> temporal deſtruction; and 4. the dead Saints with reward (as was ſhewed) &amp; ſo ſaith the Apoſtle, Chriſt will judg the quick &amp; dead at his appearance &amp; Kingdom, in 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1. and all theſe four marks of that part of Judgment are the proper Characters of the Judgments of the ſaid great Day, which belong alſo to the laſt Judgment above 1000 years after <hi>Daniels,</hi> as <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.11. to the end, after the laſt <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> ſhall be deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: and here we finde not any of theſe marks of that Judgment at any other time when the Old World or <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> were deſtroyed, though theſe are both in ſome reſpects made patterns of the other by our Saviour, <hi>Luke</hi> 17. <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> probably of the firſt when many terrible Judgments will finde out many ſorts of wicked men, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the other a pattern of the general deſtruction of the world by fire, as the other was by a Deluge of Water. <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalems</hi> firſt and ſecond deſtructions are alſo patterns, and the Pagan-Idolators and Perſecutors deſtruction, which is ſet forth like a day of Judgment, <hi>Rev.</hi> 6.12. to the end; and ſo in that large deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the deſolation of the Churches enemies, <hi>Eſai.</hi> 34. throughout the whole Chapter: but in none of theſe or any other do we finde theſe four Characters peculiar to the Judgments of the ſaid great Day; but only in <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. and <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. we read of many excellent points Chriſt informed ſuch as lived in the viſible Church, or ſuch as have to do with his Servants there; as by him that had not the Wedding garment, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.11. ſhewing that nothing will ſerve
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:42450:10"/>Profeſſors, but being by faith inveſted with his righteouſneſs; and by three Parables together, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. Firſt, that the fooliſh Virgins were ſhut out for want of true faith and grace, though they were formal Profeſſors; and his own Servants (whether Miniſters, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, or other Chriſtians in the Church) to whom the Talents were delivered to improve when he went into a far Country, <hi>viz.</hi> to Heaven as he expounds it, <hi>Luke</hi> 19. when one failed he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned; and in that 3d which is more general but yet reſtrained to the viſible Church likewiſe, or ſuch as had to do with his Servants, whom in their afflictions or perſecutions they ſhould have fed, clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed, viſited, which he looks as done to himſelf; but for the want of this all ſuch will be condemned: And alas! alas! how few conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der any ſuch proceeding of Chriſt in Judgment, that are deeply in ſuch caſe concerned; men are in theſe days far ſhort of the love, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion and zeal of the Primitive Chriſtians, who ſold their poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.37. But to omit many paſſages to like purpoſes, as ſome to be condemned by the Law, ſome without the Law by their own Conſcience, ſome by the Goſpel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but above all, Chriſt hath in the ſaid Revelation made many great points known, not known before of the ſaid Judgment of the Great day; as that there is a ſecond act or general Judgment to be celebrated by Chriſt, as well as that <hi>Daniel</hi> had the Viſion of, and he had before confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and ſhews what diſtance of time ſhall be betwixt them, <hi>viz.</hi> above 1000 years, and what things are to intervene betwixt them in the 1000 years, and how the laſt ſhall be brought on by Gods raining fire from Heaven upon the laſt attempt of the laſt <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> and at his ſitting on the Throne, Heaven and Earth ſhould be diſſolved, and <hi>the Earth, the Sea, and the Grave ſhall give up their dead,</hi> that they ſhall be judged by their ſeveral diſtinct books, the elect out of the Book of life, <hi>and the Devil firſt be caſt into the lake of fire,</hi> where <hi>the Beaſt and falſe Prophet were caſt</hi> before 1000 years, and more, and ſo ſhould death and hell afterward; which in ſuch reſpects ſeems to ſhew their utter end in the world, as in <hi>Chap.</hi> 17.11. but more to them that are capable of more: theſe by Chriſt are Divinely delivered of the ſaid Judgment, no where in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſo made known before; and ſo of both Reſurrections, after <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay,</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> then <hi>Daniel</hi> had much myſtically ſhewed him in Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; that they ſat on Thrones ſet for them, and Judgment or pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of judging was given then to the Saints; but that the ſuffering Saints ſhould come at that time with Chriſt, coming in the Clouds of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:42450:11"/>Heaven, and be raiſed by Chriſt to reign with him 1000 years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the raiſing of the reſt of the dead good or bad, and that all the promiſed mercies ſhould then be fulfilled to them, none could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal theſe but Chriſt, who had this Book with ſeven Seals given to him by the Father in ſuch a glorious manner, when none elſe in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven or earth was found worthy to open it, or look into it, or much leſs to fulfil the contents of it, but only the Lamb, that had, as it were been ſlain, and lived again, but will then appear to be the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> the Root of <hi>David,</hi> as well as the Branch: the Father only reſerved theſe things to be made known by his Son, the Wiſdom of the Father, the Eternal Word, in the boſom of the Father; and therefore theſe his Divine Oracles concerning all ſuch laſt things are chiefly to be attended to as Gods and Chriſts utmoſt infallible reſolution of all ſuch things as were not ſo fully and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly explained concerning Reſurrections or Judgment of all ſorts before; or what is to be fulfilled upon the foundations of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets in the interim of the 1000 years betwixt both: the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> who was rapt into the third Heaven, reveals many things of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, &amp; ſhews ſome Myſteries of that &amp; the Judgment, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4. and elſewhere, but much thereof cannot from thence be rightly expounded without Chriſts ſaid Revel. <hi>ch.</hi> 20. which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeems in theſe reſpects much more clearly and diſtinctly delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red than any of that Book before or after, as we hope to ſhew: and therefore theſe Revelations of all ſuch laſt things are not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained by other Scriptures that ſpeak not of ſuch things, but all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that either ſpeak in general of them, or not explicitly of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the ſaid particulars, are in thoſe reſpects to be explained by our Saviours Revelation, whoſe wiſdom is infallible, his truth unerring, <hi>being the ſaithful and true witneſs,</hi> and all ſuch his Revelations are ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt reſolutions in the caſe, and ſure foundations therein to reſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and the rather, becauſe of the Divine charge to the contrary, with the terrible penalty annexed unto theſe Doctrines, which is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry evident doth reſpect the ſame eſpecially, <hi>Chap.</hi> 22.18.19. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning willing at leaſt, or much more willful, adding to or taking away any thing from the Propheſie of this Book, which ought not ſlightly to be overlooked, beſides, many other conſiderations which might be added: that of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. <hi>ver.</hi> 23. as the Revelation ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains it, Chriſt was the firſt fruits of the Saints Reſurrection above 1600 years before his coming at Antichriſts deſtruction, when the ſuffering Sts. ſhall riſe which he brings with him [<hi>ita deinde,</hi> as ſaith
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:42450:11"/>the Apoſtle] then cometh the end: as in <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.1000 years after and more; and a reaſon is added, all Chriſts enemies muſt firſt be put un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his feet; <hi>viz.</hi> firſt, <hi>Ezekiels Gog</hi> &amp; <hi>Magog,</hi> Turk &amp; Pope, as we ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and all taken then out of Chriſts Kingdom that offend, and 1000 years after, when the laſt <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog, Rev</hi> 20. ſhall be deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the Devil that ſeduced them caſt into the lake of fire, then will the laſt enemy death alſo be deſtroyed; but in the interim all the ſaid thouſand years, ſaith the Apoſtle, he muſt reign, till that laſt enemy death be alſo deſtroyed; after which he will deliver up his Davidical Kingdom to the Father, as was ſaid <hi>ver.</hi> 24. but at <hi>ver.</hi> 51, 52. he declares certain myſteries not known before con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the general ſudden rapture and change at the laſt Trump, and laſt Reſurrection, which ſuit with Revelation order alſo (though thoſe myſteries and Chriſts laſt deſcending with a ſhout at the ſame time, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4. ſeem to be only revealed to the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi>) yet the diſtinction of Chriſts bringing his ſaid Saints with him at his next coming, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.13. and 4.14. and his ſudden rapping them up above 1000 years after, to meet him in the Air when he deſcends with the ſaid Trump of God, <hi>v.</hi> 16. at the coming of the Lord (as it is alſo called, <hi>ver.</hi> 15.) from which time they ſhall ever be with the Lord, which was not true from the former, as by <hi>Revel.</hi> 20. is manifeſt; which is alſo another evident ground of diſtinguiſhing the ſame, and by the Revelation-order, ſo to be explained; which is not to be underſtood according to any mens apprehenſions of other Scriptures: but other Scriptures to be explained by that in all ſuch matters as God hath given unto Chriſt in that moſt Divine Book to reſolve his Church of in ſuch particulars therein held out: and as for that of <hi>Peter.</hi> 2.3. upon which ſome miſtaken apprehenſions of ſome ſeem to have put ſome difficulties, by the help of the <hi>Revel.</hi> may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily be reſolved, if we conſider he ſpeaks both of the Scoffers of the laſt times, and to faithful Chriſtians likewiſe, and ſuits conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions uſeful for both: to the Scoffers he offers the conſideration of the day of the Lord; that is the great day of Judgment wherein is the morning Judgment contained; when Chriſt is ſaid to come as a thief, at the end of the 6th Vial, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16.15. about the <hi>Armageddon</hi> battle, as here he is ſaid, alſo to come as a thief in the night, then will be the conſuming of the body of the Beaſt by fire, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. and <hi>ver.</hi> 10. a fiery ſtream iſſued from the Ancient of days at that Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: but this ſeems by our Saviour (beſides other conſiderations) to be a partial deſtruction, chiefly falling upon wicked men, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:42450:12"/>things, being guided by the Spirit of Chriſt to write concerning mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters directly reſpecting the laſt times did know the particular mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them in thoſe reſpects as they are explained ſince by the Book of Revelation: I muſt ingeniouſly acknowledge that in things which were ſo by the ſame Spirit of Chriſt, further in due time to be revealed, I believe they did not: for firſt, it is probable they would then, with the ſaid things, have given the Interpretation of them if they had then known them: And ſecondly, the Holy Spirit of Chriſt would not have given particular Revelations to open and explain the particular meanings if they had not been neceſſary ſo to have been revealed in reſpect of the hidden parts of them, and eſpecially that God the Father in a glorious wonderful manner, <hi>Rev.</hi> 5. ſhould ſo give that moſt Divine Book to his beloved Son the Lamb ſo to reveal them (as he hath done) without which the Church had been in the dark, in regard of many excelent points of Heavenly Doctrines now only knowable by the help and uſe of the ſaid Book (eſpecially in what concerns the main Scope of all Revelation-Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie) which is therefore highly to be eſteemed and diligently to be ſtudied by all wiſe and good Chriſtians for the right underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the darkeſt portions of Scripture which are not rightly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered by any other means but by theſe Divine Oracles of Jeſus Chriſt; and let it henceforth ſtand as an irrefragable Rule amongſt all ſound Chriſtians, that all thoſe Texts of holy Scriptures concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thoſe laſt things, <hi>viz.</hi> Reſurrections and Judgment are to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained by Chriſts Revelation and not the Revelation by them.</p>
               <p>From the former ſaid ſure Rule, and the many foundations for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly laid down in the whole work, theſe Divine Concluſions or Chriſtian Doctrines will evidently follow:</p>
               <p>Firſt, That Chriſts Davidical Kingdom on earth will begin with the firſt act or ſeſſion of the Judgment of the Great Day, above 1000 years before the Laſt Judgment, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 9. <hi>Luke</hi> 1.32. with <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. and 19.6, 9, 11, to the end.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That at the firſt ſaid Seſſion the quick, namely the Beaſt &amp; falſ Prophet with other great and ſmall enemies then living will be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by temporal deſtruction from the earth, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. <hi>Ezek</hi> 38.39. <hi>Dan.</hi> 11.45. <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.41. And the deceaſed Saints will then alſo be judged with a Judgment of reward or recompenſe at their holy
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:42450:13"/>and bleſſed bodily Reſurrection, when they ſhall riſe to reign with Chriſt, who will then ſo Judge both quick and dead at his appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Kingdom, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.18. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Chriſt will reign with his ſaid raiſed Saints on earth in his ſaid Kingdom all that ſame 1000 years, wherein (as he hath both ſtrongly and emphatically taught us) that Satan ſhall be bound from deceiving the Nations any more until the ſaid 1000 years ſhall be ſulfilled. See Treatiſe on <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.5. <hi>page</hi> 37, 38. and <hi>page</hi> 8. of this.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The ſaid 1000 years ſpace to be ſo fulfilled beginning from the firſt ſaid Seſſion, or <hi>Matutinum Judicium</hi> (as Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> ſpeaks, or a greater than he, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49.14. and a greater than them both, <hi>Luke</hi> 19.18, 19. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.26.) before the little ſpace of Satans looſing again, is that interim before the laſt Judgment wherein ſhall be the performance of Gods moſt antient promiſed Mercies and Covenants to the faithful Forefathers, and to their ſpiritual Seed [<hi>viz.</hi> the then raiſed Saints and others then converted] through their Divine promiſed Seed Chriſt, by whom they ſhall all then have their ſure Mercies of <hi>David, Eſa.</hi> 55.3. and as the Lambs wife, then inherit all things with him, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.7.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, The New Jeruſalem ſtate, the Marriage of the Lamb, the Paradiſe of God with the pure River and Tree of Life therein and the Nations of them that are then ſaved walking in the light of the ſaid great holy and beloved New Jeruſalem, wherein conſiſts the New Heavens and new earth, when God will make all things new, as in this Text, are the contemporaries of the ſaid happy times and ſtate in the ſaid 1000 years, and will make up that happineſs in the ſaid Davidical Kingdom of Chriſt, both to the ſaid Saints then rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and to the then converted Jews and Gentiles in the natural life, when alſo the two ſecond great calls of them both will be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.43. <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.10. that Jews and Gentiles will rejoyce together.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, Satans laſt moſt wicked attempt with his laſt <hi>Gog</hi> &amp; <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gog</hi> againſt the ſaid holy City and the Camp of the Saints after the ſaid 1000 years are ended, will occaſion fire from Heaven to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume them, and probably the earth and the works upon it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and thereupon alſo the deſtruction of the laſt enemy death, when all the Saints both raiſed before, and then living or lying in the grave (to free them (as is probable) from the deſtruction with wicked men then) ſhall be rapt up together, and all be changed in a moment or
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:42450:13"/>twinkling of an eye to meet Chriſt in the Air, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> when alſo all the wicked ſhall be raiſed at the laſt Trump to the laſt general Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and final ſentence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> upon whoſe ſitting upon the great white Throne will be the utter diſſolution of the whole created world, as <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.11, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And theſe (I believe) are upon the many ſaid accounts from ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture, the Divine truths of Jeſus Chriſt, not contradicting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing taught in Gods Word before, but only explaining many things formerly darkly, yet Divinely couched therein, and eſpecially things reſpecting the ſaid firſt and ſecond bodily Reſurrections, and the proceedings of the Judgment of the great day of the Lord at above a 1000 years diſtance, with the performance of the promiſed mercies in the interim (as was ſaid.)</p>
               <p>And thus have I given an account of my faith as reſpecting theſe things for which I bleſs and magnifie the glorious Name of God the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, three Perſons, and one true and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>living God, and I do believe that all Saints will do the ſame here or hereafter. Amen.</p>
               <p>And thus for the Queſtions concerning the firſt Reſurrection, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Inlet to the Sts. that Chriſt brings with him when he comes into the happy ſaid approaching ſtate 1000 years before the ſaid reſt of the dead ſhall live again; and that anſwers to ſundry portions of Scripture that are by ſome otherwiſe expounded, but are only to be underſtood by the help of the moſt Divine Book of the Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Jeſus Chriſt, as we have ſhewed.</p>
               <p>And now before we proceed to ſpeak particularly of the words or matters of this Text of the Renovation of all things, which are to make up the happineſs of Chriſts ſaid Reign with his Saints upon the ſaid firſt Reſurrection: we ſhall conſider the preceding and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing context thereof with its dependencie, to remove ſome other ſeeming difficulties, which for the greater evidence we ſhall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to do by Anſwering ſome other Queſtions, and reſolving ſome doubts upon weighty reaſons concerning the ſame.</p>
               <p>Queſt. 1. <hi>Are not the New Heavens and the New earth the renovation of all things the New Jeruſalem and Paradiſe of God,</hi> &amp;c. Ch. 21.22. to be after the laſt Judgment, wch is ſet down before them in <hi>Ch.</hi> 20.11.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Although the laſt Judgment is there placed in the end of the foregoing Chapter, it doth not follow that it will be in time before thoſe great things ſpoken of in the two following Chapters, but it will appear to be there placed upon other ſpecial reaſons. One
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:42450:14"/>Reaſon is from the reference of divers things ſpoken of <hi>Chap.</hi> 19. which are further explained in their order in the three following Chapters, and conſequently of their dependance thereupon.</p>
               <p>A ſecond Reaſon is from the ſpecial conſideration of <hi>Chap.</hi> 20. to <hi>ver.</hi> 11. as the Table of the good times of Gods Church, as <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. to <hi>ver.</hi> 15. was the Table of the bad times, as after we hope to make manifeſt in the Divine contrivance of this ſacred Book to the good advantage of right enquirers.</p>
               <p>But firſt, for the Reaſon of ſuch things <hi>Chap.</hi> 19. as refer to the three following Chapters:</p>
               <p>The firſt is from <hi>ver.</hi> 6. after many great Hallelujahs for the the Whores deſtruction, <hi>ver.</hi> 1, 2. redoubled again, <hi>ver.</hi> 3. and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, they ſaid Hallelujah. Thirdly, of the repreſentative 24 El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and four Beaſts, or four living Wights worſhipping God, and adding their Amen, to their Allelujah (for ſuch will be the high prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of God in the hearts and mouths of Gods people then for his deſtroying of <hi>Babylon,</hi> called here his judging of the great Whore for her great provocations) [mark that expreſſion, for then will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin Chriſts great day of Judgment] <hi>v.</hi> 2. &amp; <hi>v.</hi> 5. there is a Divine ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral enforcement to the like praiſe to all Gods Servants not only for this ſaid ruine of <hi>Babylon,</hi> but for the enſuing reign of Chriſt thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſet forth in wonderful expreſſions, <hi>ver.</hi> 6. <hi>ſaying Allelujah for the Lord, God Omnipotent reigneth;</hi> which is the firſt general referring to the future Chapters, and this is further explained Ch. 20. of Chriſts reign with his Saints 1000 years, and the ſame 1000 wherein Satan was to be bound, which for its certainty is ſix times ſaid to be ſo three times abſolutely, and three times relatively.</p>
               <p>The ſecond general, <hi>Chap.</hi> 19. <hi>ver.</hi> 7. is the coming of the Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of the Lamb, which is explained <hi>Chapter</hi> 21.2, 9, 10. in the New <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſtate, unto which matter of joy and thanksgiving there is a third addition in general, that the Lambs wife hath made her ſelf ready in the ſame verſe, which ſeems ſpecially to reſpect the calling of the Jews, then to be betrohed for ever, when the Tabernacle of God is alſo ſaid to be with men, <hi>c.</hi> 21.3, 4. at that his coming which the many Hallelujahs in the Hebrew tongue then to be ſung ſeem to point out to us, and not only Jews and Iſraelites will then be brought into Chriſts ſheepfold; but all the Nations of them that are ſaved and ſhall all walk together in the light of the Jeruſalem that came from God out of Heaven (being all to be then of one Communion of Sts.
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:42450:14"/>though in ſeveral capacities celebrating accordingly the Marriage of the Lamb the ſaid 1000 years, <hi>v.</hi> 2.9, 10, 22, 24, 26. and as from the Throne of God and the Lamb, then and there proceeds that pure River of the water of Life, <hi>viz.</hi> all Divine Grace, <hi>John</hi> 7.37, 38. ſo in the middeſt of the ſtreet of the City then will be the Tree of Life in that bleſſed ſtate of that Paradiſe of God, <hi>chap.</hi> 22.1, 2. as <hi>chap.</hi> 2.7. is alſo explained, which will be more gloriouſly reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red then by and for Chriſt the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> than the ſtate of that was which the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> loſt in many reſpects, when God, as in the Text, makes all things new.</p>
               <p>Now concerning ſuch a neer Union of all Gods Saints and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants at the ſaid Marriage of the Lamb according to their ſeveral capacities, we have much in the Prophets obſervable; we ſhall on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly name a few texts, as <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.19, 20. <hi>I will betroth thee unto me for ever, in Righteouſneſs, in Judgment, in Loving Kindneſs, and in Mercies:</hi> the whole 45th <hi>Pſalm,</hi> and much in <hi>Eſa.</hi> 60, &amp; 62, &amp; 65, &amp; 66. all reſpecting the ſame time and ſtate, and is in part applyed, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. And thus much of the reference of theſe three laſt <hi>chap.</hi> to the ſaid general heads mentioned <hi>chap.</hi> 19. of Chriſts ſaid Reign, the Marriage of the Lamb, and his Wives making her ſelf ready, which is uſually in Scripture, and eſpecially in this book, to mention Generals, and after particularly to explain them: and beſide theſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that there is no diſtinction of order or times in the three follow-Chapters by firſt ſecond or third, or after this I ſaw, as <hi>chap.</hi> 18.1. at the Whores deſtruction, or after theſe things I heard, <hi>chap.</hi> 19.1. but from thence to the end of the book all the Viſions are of the ſame time, as we may after ſhew. But becauſe the opening of this Rereference in <hi>chap.</hi> 19. is of great uſe to the underſtanding of all the reſt of this book to the end, we ſhall endeavour according to what by Divine Grace we have received, to reſolve theſe Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons following.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Why theſe great things ſhould here be inſerted, <hi>chap.</hi> 19.5, 6, 7. after <hi>Babylons</hi> deſtruction?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Why the deſtruction of the Beaſt and falſe Prophet from <hi>ver.</hi> 11. to the end of the <hi>Chapter</hi> is decyphered before them?</p>
               <p n="3">3. What is meant by that in <hi>v.</hi> 9 where it's ſaid, <hi>Bleſsed are they that are called to the Marriage Supper of the Lamb,</hi> which is ſet forth with ſo much Divine Illuſtration? Much after the manner that Gods Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation is ſet forth in this text. The firſt is to teach us, that <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons</hi> ruine is the beginning of Chriſts Reign, <hi>chap.</hi> 11.17. he then
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:42450:15"/>takes to himſelf his great power and reigns, as here, <hi>ver.</hi> 6. which ſeems to be the that beginning of Revenges, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.40, &amp;c.) and when God begins then he will alſo make an end) for by this God prepares for a greater and more general revenge upon the Enemies, by provoking them to gather to the <hi>Armageddon</hi> Battel, as <hi>chap.</hi> 16. <hi>ver.</hi> 13, 14, 15. by ſending the three unclean Spirits, or Spirits of Devils afterwards to the Kings of the Earth, and of the whole world, to gather them to it, which is here gloriouſly decyphered, <hi>ver.</hi> 11. to the end.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To manifeſt to the Churches Conſolation, that as the Beaſt had ſcattered the power of the holy people, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.7. for his time, times, and half a time; ſo then his power ſhould be ſo ſcattered, that there remains no more but to prepare for the greateſt Vengeance at his laſt deſtruction: he ſhall never more hurt or moleſt them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To inſtruct us how the Morning Judgment of the great day, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by <hi>Daniel,</hi> chap. 7. will be brought on: Firſt by judging the Whore. 2dly, the Beaſt and falſe Prophet, with their Followers, as is written, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 149. <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. the laſt: for <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>ſhall deſtroy the man of Sin at the appearance of his coming:</hi> ſo when Chriſt comes from the right hand of his Father, he makes his ſoes his footſtool, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.1. whom the Heavens receive till the times of Reſtitution of all things, ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> Acts 3.19, 20, 21. [for they all contemporate.]</p>
               <p n="4">4. To aſſure us of the beginning then alſo of that ſaid happy ſtate of Chriſts Church, <hi>chap.</hi> 11.18, 19, &amp; 19.6, 7. for when Chriſt comes in the Clouds he brings all his Saints with him; who probably may have that honour to execute that wrath in part upon thoſe Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, who ſhall then alſo in that Judgment receive their reward, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.13, 14. <hi>ver.</hi> 22. <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.18. to teach all Gods people then to lift up their heads, as our Saviour directs, <hi>Luke</hi> 21.28.31. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their Redemption is neer; and that Kingdome of God alſo: and though there will be then great ſhakings of the Enemies, out of the world, as <hi>Numb.</hi> 25. <hi>Eſ.</hi> 2.17, 18, 19. yet God will ſend his Angels then to gather his Elect from the four corners of the Earth, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.3. <hi>and two ſhall be</hi> then <hi>in the field, the one ſhall be taken the other left</hi> v. 40, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>To the third Queſtion we Anſwer, That theſe generals of Chriſts Kingdome are explained in the following Chapters after Antichriſts ruine, to ſhew the firſt eminent act of power Chriſt will manifeſt when he begins to reign, will be to remove that great offender out of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:42450:15"/>the way, who hath ſo long obſtructed the happy communion of God and Chriſt, with all the Saints, which they ſhall enjoy upon his removal, when the ſaid Marriage of the Lamb takes place, and Gods antient people are turned to him, (as was ſaid.)</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe that is the eminent breaking of the Serpents head by the firſt Judgment revealed to <hi>Enoch,</hi> ſeen in Viſion by <hi>Daniel, Dan.</hi> 7. explained and confirmed, and to be fulfilled by Chriſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.18. &amp; <hi>chap.</hi> 19. as may farther after appear, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which firſt Judgment of the wicked quick, is that <hi>removens pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hibens,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving the hinderance, and therefore ſeems firſt neceſſary to be done, to make way for that ſaid happy enſuing ſtate, as <hi>Mat</hi> 13.41, 42. and is an eminent breaking of the Serpents head, as the deſtroying the laſt Enemy Death will be the total and final break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof.</p>
               <p>The next Queſtion is, What is meant <hi>ver.</hi> 9. by that they are ſaid to be bleſſed that are called to the Marriage Supper of the Lamb?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Why the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> is commanded to write it?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Why the Angel adds as he teſtifiedth, <hi>Theſe are the true ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Why the Angel reſiſting his attempt to worſhip him, enjoyns him to worſhip God, as in <hi>chap.</hi> 22.9.?</p>
               <p n="5">5. Why he tells him he is his fellow Servant, and of his Brethren, [the Prophets, <hi>chap.</hi> 22.] and here adds, <hi>That have the Teſtimony of Jeſus:</hi> and then adds, <hi>Worſhip God:</hi> giving this reaſon; <hi>For the Teſtimony of Jeſus is the Spirit of Propheſie?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To reſolve the firſt Queſtion, theſe three things are to be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; Firſt, What is meant by the Marriage Supper of the Lamb.</p>
               <p n="2">2. What is their Calling to it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. How they are ſaid to be bleſſed that are called to it: and theſe we deſire a little to explain, though but in our paſſage, becauſe they have been miſapplyed formerly.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Marriage Supper of the Lamb is the enſuing deſtruction of the Beaſt, and the like wicked Enemies ſhortly after the Whore <hi>chap.</hi> 18. for which the many ſaid Halelujahs were ſung, when in ſuch a terrible, powerful and glorious manner Chriſt comes to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy them with his heavenly Armies, and his Garments dipt in blood, and takes the Beaſt and falſe Prophet, and caſts them into the fiery lake for ever; and that is denoted by the great Voice of the Angel ſtanding in the Sun to call all the Fowls to the ſame Supper, <hi>ver.</hi> 18. who alſo were filled with their fleſh, <hi>ver.</hi> laſt., who were
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:42450:16"/>ſlain with the Sword of Chriſts mouth, that is, according to his Word: who is therefore ſaid in Righteouſneſs to Judge, and make War, <hi>ver.</hi> 11. and then to judge, becauſe it will be the firſt act of his Judgment, as <hi>chap.</hi> 11.18.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This ſenſe may farther appear from other like expreſſions in Scripture, of a Sacrifice God will make of his Enemies, or a Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per or Feaſt, as here; ſo <hi>Eſa.</hi> 346. a great part of that <hi>c.</hi> and <hi>v.</hi> 4. is applyed to the deſtruction of thoſe Pagan Perſecutors, <hi>Rev.</hi> 6. the like alſo <hi>Jer.</hi> 46.10. Gods day of Vengeance is called a Sacrifice: But moſt pertinent is that of <hi>Gogs</hi> the <hi>Turks</hi> deſtruction, at or about the ſame time, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 39.17, 18, 19, &amp;c. yea and of <hi>Magog</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife, [the Pope] <hi>v.</hi> 6. briefly there mentioned, becauſe it was to be farther explained in the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> as the <hi>Jews</hi> Enemy [the <hi>Turk</hi>] is largly in the Old [<hi>ſee our</hi> 4th <hi>Obſer.</hi>] of both which thoſe hints of Reaſons ſeem conſiderable, beſides many others both in <hi>Ezek. Dan.</hi> and the Book of <hi>Revelation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe the <hi>Turk</hi> is ſtiled <hi>Gog</hi> in the Land of <hi>Magog, ver.</hi> 1. that is, in the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, a great part whereof he ſhould ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due unto himſelf.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This is farther manifeſt in that he is deſigned by God to be the great Ruiner of that Empire, to revenge upon it the blood of the Saints ſhed before under the Red Dragon, being acknowledged by many to be the 2d Woe, or 6th Trumpet, falling chiefly on the Eaſtern Empire.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He is a greater Ruiner of it than the <hi>Saracens</hi> before him who did but puſh at it, and got ſcarce half ſo much as he hath ſince over-flowed in it by his multitudes, <hi>Dan.</hi> 11.40, 41, 42, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Magog,</hi> v. 6. is deſcribed to be in the Iſles, as the <hi>Jews</hi> reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all remote from their own continent to live in the Iſles.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is the chief thing promiſed to Chriſt as the Son of <hi>David;</hi> And the Promiſe of <hi>Canaan</hi> made to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſpiritual Seed before (wherein the Holy City <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is ſaid to be prepared for the Fore-fathers was alſo contained therein, as <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.16.) and hence the ſtate of his people in <hi>Canaan</hi> did by degrees grow up into a Kingdome (as the Scripture manifeſts) as the main thing inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: for after the Promiſe to <hi>Abraham,</hi> both he, <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> were Pilgrims and Strangers in the world a long time, and their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural race long after in bondage in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> 400 years in their Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs condition; and when they poſſeſſed <hi>Canaan,</hi> they were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der many oppreſſors above 400 years, in the times of the Judges: but at laſt they grew up into a Kingdome in <hi>Davids</hi> and <hi>Solomons</hi> time, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but when their Poſterity had forfeited both Land and City, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they have ſince remained in bondage all the times of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> Monarchies, almoſt 2300 years, and ſo muſt (probably) do till <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> Tabernacle (as the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> ſpeaks, from <hi>Amos</hi> 9.11.) ſhall be raiſed up again: for Chriſt with his raiſed Sts. at the times of Reſtitut. of all things; that therefore being the laſt &amp; chief thing promiſed, and the reſt ſeem to make up the glory &amp; happineſs thereof, it is therefore here firſt ſpoken of again in the table of the good times: So that where
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:42450:21"/>God left off before in fulfilling Antient Promiſes to the Fathers for the ſins of their natural Race in that chief Mercy of the Kingdome there likewiſe, he here in revealing his Reſtauration for the comfort of their ſpiritual Race begins with again in that ſaid glorious King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Chriſt to come: in both which reſpects it being the chief thing promiſed, and alſo ſhortly now to be performed for Chriſt and his Saints, it may appear very meet and congruous that it ſhould here be ſet in the Table of theſe good times in the firſt place, as the meaſure of all the reſt that follow, which do all but make up the happineſs of that Kingdome; as Chriſt reckoned his Sufferers and two Witneſſes chief in the bad times, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. which times alſo are chiefly meaſured by the 1260 dayes of years, during their Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſying in Sackcloth: So in the Renovation God ſeems to begin <hi>chap.</hi> 20. where in their natural Race by reaſon of their ſins, he had left, and in <hi>chap.</hi> 21, and 22. proceeds backward to ſpeak of the reſt, and laſtly, of the Paradiſe of God, the firſt loſt, and laſt to be reſtored by Chriſt the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> in that ſtate in the world.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And for the bringing on of this Kingdome of Chriſt the Son of <hi>David</hi> with his raiſed Saints, God hath ever ſince the fall of that Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle, overturned all the Gentiles States and Kingdoms ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively in their orders, (as in <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> Image, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2. and <hi>Daniels</hi> Viſions of the four Beaſts deſtroying each other, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. was ſignified) and will ſtill do ſo till the God of Heaven ſet up this Kingdom as the top of theſe Mercies, that ſhould never be deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but as the Kingdome of the Stone ſhould deſtroy all others in the world, till it became a Mountain filling the whole Earth, (which Chriſt hath now almoſt fulfilled) and which will be that ſtate there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in the 1000 years of the reign of Chriſt with his Raiſed Saints, for which the ſaid Reſtitution of all things will be accompliſhed, which was ſpiritually and powerfully begun at Chriſts firſt coming, upon his Reſurrection and Aſoention, when he led: Captivity Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, tryumphing gloriouſly over all the powers of Darkneſs, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.15. and though ever ſince the Prince of the power of the Aire, that ruleth effectually in the Children of Diſobedience hath prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in all the ſuffering times under the Dragon and Beaſt, now almoſt for 1700 years to bring on Perſecutions and Sufferings of the Saints, who notwithſtanding by Chriſts Divine and Powerful Grace have been carryed on to ſuffer with him or for him; yet in that ſtate ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching, he will not only free them from all ſuch Miſeries, and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils now in the world through Sin, but bring them into that happy
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:42450:22"/>ſtate of Reigning in the world with himſelf as his Spouſe, that with him ſhall then in her it all things, with their ſure Mercies of <hi>David.</hi> in this Univer ſalo and perpetual Kingdome in the world: in reſerence unto which, the Renovation of all things will then be made by God himſelf, as in the Text.</p>
               <p>The third Queſtion: <hi>But how doth it appear that ſuch a coming and Kingdome of Christ ſhall be above</hi> 1000 <hi>years in the world, before the laſt general Judgment, when he will deſcend with a ſhout,</hi> &amp;c. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.16.</p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It will moſt manifeſtly appear, not only from our Saviours Table of the good times, which we ſpake of but now, and from the litteral ſenſe of the 1000 years, which we ſpake ſufficiently of, <hi>pag.</hi> 38. of the <hi>Saints bodily Reſurrection,</hi> which is conſtantly granted by all ſound Expoſitors, to be litterally ſo underſtood: neither is it other viſe taken in the Beaſts 42 months: nor are the Prophetical dayes of the two Witneſſes, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.

(as Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> obſerved) that Chriſt ſet down things more plainly there, than in all that book before: &amp; becauſe men have been averſe to think ſo of theſe laſt parts, there have come up many miſtaken conceits of anticipating Satans binding in the primative times of Perſecution, &amp; the Saints reigning under their greateſt ſufferings, but not in the ſence here intended, which will alſo be performed: and the taking the New Jeruſulem ſtate for the Kingdom of Heaven, and the New Heavens and New Earth to be after the laſt Judgment, and the like: which being reſolved by the Scripture Foundations to which this part of the <hi>Revel.</hi> hath particular referonce, they will upon due conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion appear very evidently to belong to this ſet time of the 1000 years us by our 15 Reaſons why they ſhall be in the world may alſo be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, and by our firſt Convincing Arg. of 36 Particulars to be accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Scripture, before, in, &amp; after the ſaid 1000 years; and by our

               <p>Object. <hi>But many Learned men have conceived that gloriouss City de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyphered,</hi> Rev. 21. <hi>and the Paradiſe of God to be the Kingdome of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in the higheſt Heavens.</hi>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Beſides our former ſaid approved Reaſons that it will be in the World, the Apoſtle <hi>Paul, Gal.</hi> 4. calls that the <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> that is now above, the Mother of all Saints, being the peculiar Manſion at preſent of all the Spirits of Juſt men made perfect, where they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in happy Security, Peace and Bleſſedneſs in their preſent ſtate, expecting the time of the ſaid firſt Reſurrection of their bodies, which when Chriſt comes and brings them with him to raiſe and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite their Spiritual Bodies with them, will be the <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> here ſaid then to come down from God out of Heaven, which glorious place and City is prepared by God for the Fathers then, and all ſuch; as the Apoſtle teacheth, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.16, 40. that without us ſhall not be made perfect, or perfect in one, as our Saviour prayed, <hi>John</hi> 17. which are called the Lambs Wife; of the ſolemnity of whoſe Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage the Kingly Prophet <hi>David</hi> foretold, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45. when that Bride, inſtead of Fathers, ſhall then have Children whom ſhe may make Princes in all Lands: and as <hi>Solomon</hi> in his moſt excellent Song in the book of <hi>Canticles</hi> divinely illuſtrateth it, of the return of the <hi>Shula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite,</hi> and the like; which will be the fulfilling of the Covenant to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Spiritual Seed, by that one Divine Seed Chriſt in that ſtate and time: and for the Paradiſe of God annexed to that
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:42450:23"/>ſtate which Chriſt will then reſtore inſtead of that loſt before in the world by the firſt <hi>Adam;</hi> it will be part of the Reſtitution which God will then effect, as we hope in due place farther to manifeſt from this Text.</p>
               <p>But for the clearer diſcovery of what hath been ſaid, let us a little look back again to the beginning of this Chapter, where it is ſaid this Holy Man had the Viſions of the New Heavens and the New Earth, which as to their time was not after the laſt Judgment, as was ſaid; neither is there placed before it that uſual expreſſion in this Book, when things which follow are ſpoken of: <hi>[After this I ſaw]</hi> as <hi>chap.</hi> 18.1. &amp; <hi>chap.</hi> 19.1. but are 1000 years before it, as is very evident: neither is it any New making of the Material frame of them; but they will be Prophetical Heavens and Earth, (as was ſaid) ſuitable to that Kingdome wherein Chriſt will reign with his raiſed Saints (as the wood witneſſeth) of which Kingdom theſe are to be conſidered as the integral parts: for never came ſuch a King into the world before, that muſt not only have all Nations to do him ſervice, and the Heathen to be given to him for his Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and the utmoſt parts of the Earth for his poſſeſſion: but when he comes, all the <hi>Elohim,</hi> Angels or Gods muſt Worſhip him; yea, all knees in Heaven and Earth, and under the Earth, muſt then bow and be ſubject to him, owning him to be Lord: but he muſt alſo then have thoſe New Heavens and New Earth then made for him and his Spouſe: As Satan had his Myſtical Heavens before, when the Pagans worſhipped Sun, Moon and Stars: Their <hi>Mercury, Jupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Mars, Apollo,</hi> with the multitudes of their Heatheniſh falſe Deities. And hence it was under Chriſts ſpiritual Kingdome of the Stone, that there was in the primitive times a great Battel in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven betwixt <hi>Michael</hi> and his Angels, and the <hi>Dragon</hi> and his Angels, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. but the iſſue thereof was, that the Dragon was caſt down from his Heaven to the Earth: And as God very remarkably by the Miniſtry of the Prophet <hi>Jeromiah,</hi> cauſed it to be proclaimed before the Captivity of <hi>Babylon,</hi> chap. 10.11. and that verſe is only writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten (as Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> well obſerves) in the <hi>Caldean</hi> Language: whither that People was ſhortly after to be led Captives: [The Gods, ſaid he, that made not the Heavens nor the Earth, even they ſhall periſh from the Earth, and from under theſe Heavens:] and accordingly, <hi>chap.</hi> 25. God ſent by him a Cup of Wrath to be drunk by thoſe many Nations that owned ſuch Gods: And afterwards, neither <hi>Bell</hi> nor <hi>Merodach</hi> of the <hi>Caldeans</hi> could ſave themſelves or their Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:42450:23"/>from their Enemies; nor the <hi>Graecian</hi> Monſters, and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of feigned Gods and Goddeſſes could deliver themſelves, or thoſe that ſerved them: and when Pagan <hi>Rome</hi> had ingroſſed the Idol Gods of all Nations which they ſubdued, they were at Chriſts firſt coming ſtruck dumb, and ceaſed to deliver their Oracles, as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly; and after by <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Dragon was caſt out of his Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the Earth; and likewiſe that Beaſt that roſe out of the Earth afterwards, with all his Paganized Chriſtianity of Popiſh Idolatry will ſhortly alſo find <hi>Jeremiahs</hi> Proclamation true, That ſuch Idol Gods ſhall periſh from the Earth, and from under theſe Heavens: for not only all ſuch, ſuppoſed Heathen Gods, but all Pagano-Chriſtian Idols alſo will be then totally and finally caſheired for ever out of the World, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 97.7. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 2. And ſuch like Heavens were aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in Scripture to Kingdoms and States, according to many Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ental Notions, (as Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> obſerved) who reckoned what was Superiour in their States were their Heavens; as Monarchs, and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours, and what was Inferiour their Earth: But theſe New Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens and New Earth being of an Heavenly Excellency; not only <gap reason="foreign">

For as at firſt he Created the world by Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.9. the Holy Spirit moving upon the face of the Waters, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.2. ſo he hath, and doth, and will redeem and fully work his Renovation of the world by the Lamb that was ſlain, and hath ſince lived again, and the book with 7 Seals is deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to him, to open and execute the Contents thereof, as in <hi>chap.</hi> 5. by the power and effectual working of the Holy Ghoſt, one God with the Father and the Son, and proceeding from the Father and the Son: So the 24 Elders, and the 4. Beaſts or living Wights wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped him at the Whores Deſtruction, as ſitting on the Throne, <hi>chap.</hi> 19.4, &amp;c. and in the end of <hi>chap.</hi> 4. &amp; 5. though this laſt was upon aſſurance of the fulfilling of all <hi>Revelation Propheſie:</hi> But in the Text he that ſits upon the Throne with a Rainbow about it, and ſeven Lamps burning before it, ſaith, <hi>Behold, I make all things new,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Thus then Almighty God, Three in Perſons, and One in Eſſence, ſo manifeſt in his Church, that ſo Created the World, and alſo by his Son and Holy Spirit carrieth on his work of Redemption, and full Renovation of the World, who maketh known this Divine Declaration thereof by his Servant <hi>John</hi> for the uſe of his Church, in theſe latter times to be fulfilled moſt certainly (as will after appear) in the neer approaching times of the Reſtitution of all things, the next Illuſtration of it is that uſual note of Attention and Obſervation, <hi>Behold:</hi> but here to be more highly conſidered as a notation of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration &amp; Adoration; Behold, Admire the wonderful Mercy herein contained, adore him in the Divine excellency thereof: the like is done in many like Notations ſet forth by God reſpecting his wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful work begun, and by degrees carried on, and to be perfected by his Son Jeſus Chriſt, as firſt eſpecially in laying his great Foundation in <hi>Sion,</hi> Eſa. 28.16. <hi>Behold I lay in Sion a chief Corner Stone, Elect and Precious,</hi> as ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.6. which the ſaid Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſets forth with a great deal of Illuſtration in the <hi>Heberew,</hi> &amp;c. <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:42450:25"/>and to be adored and admired likewiſe therein. The like of the Womans Seed promiſed without Man, <hi>Behold a Virgin ſhall bear a Son,</hi> Eſa. 7.14. and yet a Virgin when ſhe hath a Son; but ſuch a Son as ſhould be God as well as Man, who ſhould be called <hi>Imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel,</hi> God with us: here was likewiſe matter of Admiration, and Adoration, that he that was the Eternal Father, as well as the Prince of Peace; of the increaſe of whoſe Kingdome upon the Throne of <hi>David</hi> there ſhall be no end, ſhould yet in ſuch a time be born of a Virgin, <hi>&amp;c. Eſa.</hi> 9. The like by the Angel is uſed to the Shepheards at the birth of that ſaid Virgins Son, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.10, 11. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold I bring you tidings of great joy, which ſhall be to all people,</hi> &amp;c. So when God will make the New World for his ſaid Son, <hi>Behold I make, &amp;c.</hi> and the ſeaſon of this work is the <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega</hi> of this book of <hi>Revelation,</hi> to be obſerved, and admired, and deſired too by the Saints, <hi>chap.</hi> 1.7. <hi>Behold he cometh with Clouds at the Jews Converſion,</hi> who are there ſaid to have pierced him: which I conceive will not only be in mercy to the Jews, as <hi>Zech.</hi> 12.10. but all Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds alſo of the Earth ſhall wail becauſe of him penitently alſo, when he then comes the ſecond time without ſin to Salvation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Heathen ſhall be given then to him for an Inheritance, and the utmoſt parts of the Earth for his poſſeſſion, and they ſhall alſo then ſerve him, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.27. and as the Prophet ſaith in thoſe times, ten men ſhall take hold of the skirt of a Jew, <hi>Zech.</hi> 8.32. to joyn themſelves to them in the ſervice of the God of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and the great ſhakings and deſſolations in the world when the glorious Majeſty of Chriſt ſhall then appear, as <hi>Eſa.</hi> 2.17, 19. ſo ſhaking terribly the Earth (probably) may much prepare all the Kindreds of the Earth that remain then ſo to wail with Contrition that they have not known Chriſt before, and then ſo wailingly mourn after him; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is added by the Holy Spirit, <hi>Even ſo Amen</hi> to both, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.7. <hi>[N.

And then he cometh alſo with reward for his Saints, as <hi>chap.</hi> 22.12. &amp; 11.18. The way to love Chriſts appearance, as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> perſwades all ſound Chriſtians, is to know the happy advantages that all ſuch ſhall have thereby at that time, when God will make all things New that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:42450:25"/>to Chriſts <hi>Davidical</hi> Kingdome, as here, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The next thing conſiderable reſpecting this comfortable Declaration of God, is the Confirmation of it. 1. by commanding the Holy man to record it for the comfort of his Church, <hi>Write, ſaith he.</hi> 2. He gives a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold ground of ſuch Confirmation or Record of it, firſt in regard that the words were true as antiently delivered by the God of Truth, that cannot lye, or deceive, or be deceived: but ſecondly, they are likewiſe faithful, grounded upon many gracious promiſes and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, as we hope farther to manifeſt. Come we now to conſider the main thing declared that God at ſuch a time or ſtate of things occurring in the world, makes all things new, being Emphatically called by the Apoſtle <hi>Peter, The times of Restitution of all things:</hi> which Renovation of all things is three wayes conſiderable: firſt, Negatively, what it is not. Secondly, Privatively, in reſpect of what God will then remove or take away. Thirdly, Poſitively, in reſpect of what God will do in the performance of that great and gracious work.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Negatively, in reſpect of what he will not do; it doth not imply that God will then bring a total deſtruction upon the Created World, by deſtroying it and the Creatures in it, with wicked men then to be deſtroyed out of it, and other Creatures to be placed in a New world, which we have no Scripture grounds for; but for the contrary: for that is to be done at Chriſts ſitting upon the great white Throne at the diſſolution of all things, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.11. above 1000 years after; neither in reaſon can it be conceived; for what uſe Creatures ſhould ſerve when good and bad men were removed before out of it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Privatively, by Gods removing and taking away many evil things out of the world, which have been brought into it (ſince he firſt in 7 days Created finiſhed his great and good work of Creation) by Satan, Sin, and wicked men; ſuch as the Curſe, Corruption, Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, and Enmity of the Creatures ſince abiding in it, in an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent degree with the cauſes thereof, by deſtroying many wicked men out of the Earth, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.18. and binding Satan for the 1000 years in the bottomleſs pit, that he deceive not the Nations any more till that 1000 years ſhall be finiſhed: therefore (I ſay) with the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes thereof; for <hi>ſublata cauſa tollitur effectus:</hi> and contrarily; to bring the world into a capacity to be made better, and to be put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a New and better frame than when they prevailed in it, he will then alſo eminently remove and take away thoſe many evils cauſed and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:42450:26"/>brought into the world by them: firſt, the curſe brought in by them will then be taken away: for ſaith Chriſt, there ſhall then be no more curſe, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.3. the earth which was curſed by theſe means upon the Fall, ſhall be eminently reſtored unto its native fruitfulneſs, peculiar to that time and ſtate, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34.26, 27. <hi>There ſhall then be ſhowers of bleſſing upon it, and the trees of the field ſhall yield her fruit, and the Earth ſhall yield her increaſe:</hi> and with that fruitfulneſs they ſhall then have ſafety and peace, for they ſhall be ſafe in their Land, and ſhall know that I am the Lord, being delivered from their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, as there follows, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So alſo <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.8. <hi>Ye Mountain of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, ye ſhall ſhoot forth your branches, and yield your fruit to my people of Iſrael:</hi> and ver. 11. <hi>I will multiply upon you man and beaſt, and they ſhall increaſe and bring fruit:</hi> and ver. 29, <hi>I will call for the Corne and increaſe it, and lay no famine upon you,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>yea their Land ſhall become for fruitfulneſs like the Garden of Eden,</hi> ver. 35. and Joel 3.18. <hi>The Mountains ſhall drop down with New Wine, and the Hills ſhall flow with Milk:</hi> which are high expreſſions of the fruitfulneſs of thoſe times: alſo <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.21. <hi>In that day will I hear, ſaith the Lord, I will hear the Heavens, and the they ſhall hear the Earth, and the Earth ſhall hear the Corn and the Wine and the Oyle, and they ſhall hear Jezreel.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, the Enmity of men and other creatures will then be alſo remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, which have prevailed in the world from the fall: firſt among men there hath been (ſince the fall, Murther, &amp; Slaughter, &amp; Blood ſhed prevailing and ſo will ſtill untill thoſe times) amongſt them: but then Nation ſhall no more riſe againſt Nation, neither ſhall they learn War any more; yea they ſhall beat their Swords into Plowſhares, and their Spears into Pruning hooks, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 2.4. and <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.18. <hi>I will break the Bow, and the Sword, and the Battel out of the Earth, and will make them to lie down in ſafety:</hi> and for the peaceableneſs of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Creatures which not only Allegorically (as ſome underſtand the Promiſes to that purpoſe, but they will litterally be performed) when that Savage Cruelty in their corrupt natures ſince the fall, will then be taken away, <hi>that the Wolfe ſhall dwell with the Lamb,</hi> as the Prophet <hi>Eſa.</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>chap.</hi> 11.6. <hi>and the Leopard ſhall lie down with the Kid,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and they ſhall not hurt or deſtroy in all my holy Mountain:</hi> and <hi>Eſa.</hi> 65.25. <hi>The Wolfe and the Lamb ſhall feed together, and the Lyon ſhall eat ſtraw like the Bullock,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>So the hurtful influence of the Heavens, and the diſtempers of the 4 Elements, and the noxious qualities of the Creatures will be then wonderfully refined: that <hi>the Heavens,</hi> as God promiſeth, <hi>may hear</hi>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:42450:26"/>the earth, and they hear the Corn and Wine and Oyl, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the Inhabitants of Jeruſalem ſhall not then ſay, I am ſick, when the people that dwell therein ſhall be forgiven their iniquity, <hi>Eſai.</hi> 33.24.</p>
               <p>The Creatures which ſince the Fall have been held under the bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage of corruption, under which the whole Creation ſtill groaneth, ſhall, as the Apoſtle teacheth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.21. in that ſtate be delivered from it, and that alſo into the glorious liberty of the Sons of God.</p>
               <p>The bodies of all Saints (ſaving ſome few, as <hi>Enoch, Moſes, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lias</hi>) have lien rotting in the Grave, and ſo will till then, but they ſhall all in that time and ſtate receive the Adoption, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.21. the [faithful Gentiles then receiving that with all benefits belonging to them as the ſpiritual Seed of <hi>Abraham, Gal.</hi> 3.29. as well as to his faithful natural Seed both Jews and Iſraelites] which he explains in the next words, <hi>even the redemption of our bodies</hi> [N.B.] which (as was ſhewed before) will be the inlet to all thoſe Saints into the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of that time and ſtate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And thus briefly of Gods remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the ſaid evils or the like, with the cauſes thereof. When Chriſt the Univerſal King of Kings, and Prince of the Kings of the earth, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. and <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.5. will not only reſcue the great and excellent building of the World out of the power of the Prince of the Air, but repair the ruines and deſolations he and his retinue of wicked men and Devils have wrought in it, and reduce it for himſelf and his Spouſe the Saints into a far better condition than ever it was in before, which will be by Gods ſaid removal of the ſaid evils, then when he makes all things new. Thirdly, this renovation is to be conſidered Poſitively in reſpect of Gods conferring good upon them at thoſe times of reſtitution of all things, <hi>Acts</hi> 3. <hi>viz.</hi> upon Chriſt the Lamb and his Bride then, which I conceive is taken for both ſorts of Saints both then raiſed, and in the natural life (though then in their proper different ſtates) yet by gracious diſpenſation will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably be both of one Communion, which we are taught to believe according to Gods Word, ſutable to that of Chriſt and his Diſciples forty days after he roſe from the dead.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Poſitive part is included in the ſame declaration, <hi>Gen.</hi> 13.15. after explained by many gradual Promiſes and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants. We ſhall begin with the laſt at firſt in this Divine Key of our Saviours, <hi>viz.</hi> the Kingdom promiſed to <hi>David</hi> and his Seed for ever, which is the main thing here ſpoken of, that Chriſt with his
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:42450:27"/>Saints ſhould enjoy in that ſtate, comprehending all the reſt, which all the other tend unto and are to be conferred with it, before the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of which the raiſed Saints have their ſpiritual bodies then, whereby they are put into a capacity to enjoy all the happineſs of that time and ſtate, and the Jews, Iſraelites, and Gentiles ſhall be converted and united into one ſheepfold <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This Kingdom was foretold by <hi>Jacob, Gen.</hi> 49. and by <hi>Balaam, Numb.</hi> 24. and often propheſied of by <hi>David,</hi> confirmed in <hi>Nathan</hi>'s Meſſage, ſeen in Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion by <hi>Daniel,</hi> at what time Chriſt ſhould receive it over all Nations under the whole Heavens, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.27. with many other confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by the Prophets, and declared by Chriſt that it was his Fathers pleaſure to give it to his little little flock, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.32. that they ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering with Chriſt ſhould reign with him: which in the 1000 years they are ſaid to do, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.4. of which more is ſaid in our twelve foundations of the faith thereof, and in the Word written, and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where from Scripture-Authority. For this great King are the New Heavens and earth to be made, without ſuch a myſtical moveable Sea out of which the Beaſt aroſe in the times of the Barbarous Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons Cmmotions, &amp; the Whore hath ſitten upon thoſe many troubled waters ever ſince: but this Kingdom that Chriſt with his Saints ſhall receive, is ſuch, as cannot be ſhaken or moved, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.28. this ſaid Kingdom is the firſt and main thing here ſpoken of by Chriſt (though the laſt promiſed to <hi>David</hi> and his Divine ſpiritual Seed) which the Apoſtles expected ſhould be reſtored, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.6. and will be at that time of the raiſing up of <hi>Davids</hi> Tabernacle, which had been fallen in his natural Race 2300 years (probably) before, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.16. <hi>Amos</hi> 9.11.</p>
               <p>The next thing belonging to this Kingdom for which the integral parts thereof the New Heavens and the New Earth are then to be be made, as <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.1. is that which is contained in the Covenant to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed reſpecting the promiſed Land, as the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther City thereof typified by that <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> of old which is now in bondage with her Children, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. And is now above till the time of the deſcending of it from God out of Heaven, when Chriſt comes in the Clouds of Heaven, and brings all his Saints with him, till the Marriage of the Lamb ſpoken of <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. and 21. which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the great, and holy, and beloved <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that City with foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations that <hi>Abraham</hi> expected, and is ſaid to be prepared for the forefathers, and all the faithful ſince, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.16.40. whoſe Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker and Builder is God: which appears to be in great part the New
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:42450:27"/>Heavens, as <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.20. as we in part ſhewed before, with the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of the glorious Angels coming to attend on Chriſt when his Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle of his bodily preſence will be with men, not for a little time, as <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. at his firſt coming, but he will dwell with them the ſpace of the 1000 years.</p>
               <p>Then will alſo be according to many Promiſes to the Saints in the natural life of all the Nations that ſhall then be ſaved, the New Earth wherein will dwell righteouſneſs, when Chriſt that great King ſhall reign in righteouſneſs, and Princes ſhall rule in judgment, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 32.1. whoſe Officers ſhall be peace, and whoſe Exactors ſhall be righteouſneſs, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 60.17. when Chriſt ſits upon the Throne of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> to order it, and to eſtabliſh it with Judgment and with Juſtice, from thencforth and for ever, <hi>viz.</hi> unto the end of the world, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 9.7. the Propheſies and Promiſes which reſpect that ſtate of Gods peoples mercies, benefits and Priviledges therein are exceeding great and manifold, that would require a large Volume to explain them, reſpecting Saints then in the natural life; both in being greatly freed from the evils we now ſpoke of, with the manifold enjoyments of good; but eſpecially in regard of their large meaſure of Grace then promiſed as in the New Covenant, firſt made in their Book of <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> after the firſt Tables had been brok on, remarkably ſet down <hi>Deut.</hi> 30. to <hi>ver.</hi> 11. for circumciſing the heart of that people and their Seed after all their great diſperſions; who ſhall be ſetled in their own Land then, and remove no more, as 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. and Gods Sanctuary ſhall be with them for evermore, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37.28. when God will pour his Spirit on them generally, <hi>Joel</hi> 3. as he did upon his Diſciples and ſome few at his firſt coming, and thoſe expreſſions of the New Covenant, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.33, 34. and 32.39, 40. and <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.25, 26, 27, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> do chiefly belong to that people, and ſuch as are u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited to them in the natural life in thoſe times that ſhall then walk in the light of the ſaid beloved Jeruſalem, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. (though we Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles have now our ſhare in them) through faith in ſome degree, but they then in the times of Reſtitution much more by far, and this will then be that ſpecial great foundation of all other temporal enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as the ſtrong entail that Chriſt will make them of all promiſed good.</p>
               <p>And to all Saints in thoſe times it is probable will ariſe that great enlargement of Joy for the inlarging Chriſts Kingdom with praiſe to God in Chriſt for it, by the powerful operation of the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in that, together with the inheriting of all promiſed mercies to
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:42450:28"/>themſelves, they will ſee and know then the great confluence of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Souls then abundantly coming in upon the like foundations from the Word of God, when all Nations ſhall ſee the ſalvation of the God of Iſrael, and the Heathen ſhall be given to Chriſt [Gods King then ſet upon his holy hill of <hi>Sion</hi>] for his inheritance, and the utmoſt parts of the earth for his poſſeſſion <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 2. for if the Angels in Heaven rejoyce at one ſinners converſion now: how will both Angels and Saints then rejoyce, when ſo many thouſands and millions which will then be ſaved in the prolonging of Chriſts days, when he ſhall ſee his numerous ſeed (as promiſed to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers) and the will of the Lord ſhall proſper in his hand, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 53. and his City prepared will be large enough to contain all raiſed Saints being as it is deſcribed a perfect Cube of 1500 miles in length, breadth, and heighh, fitted for the motion and benefit of their ſpiritual bodies, yet ſaid then to have foundations, becauſe then they will have their bodies, who needed no foundations when they were Jeruſalem above, only the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.2. and for the other in the natural life they ſhall lengthen their cords, &amp; ſtrengthen their ſtakes, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 54.2. God hath prepared fit places for both, who fully knows the number of them all: Now many things in Scripture are ſaid to be prepared by God or Chriſt that will not have their peculiar exiſtence at preſent till the times come: So our Saviour went to prepare the beloved great <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> for his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, <hi>John</hi> 14.1, 2, 3. where they ſhall behold this his glory which his Father hath given him, <hi>John</hi> 17.24. and this is the City prepared for the Forefathers, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.16. and for us, <hi>v.</hi> 40. ſo ſaith Chriſt, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.34. and the eternal happineſs which eye hath not ſeen, ear hath not heard, &amp; which God hath prepared, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.9. and on the contrary, Hell torment is prepared for the wicked, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.41. and Tophet is prepared of old for the King, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 30.33. probably meant of the great <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> which will at that time be deſtroyed, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>[Turk]</hi> called the <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyrian, Mich.</hi> 5.5. when the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> ſhall come into our Land, that is, poſſeſſing the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> Kingdom then: now all theſe ſo ſaid to be [prepared] ſhall have their exiſtence certainly in their times; and it ſeemeth probable that this laſt Tophet with the River of Brimſtone, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 30. will be out of the matter of the earth diſſolved at laſt, &amp;c. which will yet make for the happineſs of the Saints, that they have not only eſcaped all ſuch ſufferings, but ſhall inherit ſuch wonderful, manifold, and everlaſting happineſs.</p>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:42450:28"/>
               <p> And now we come Fourthly to the laſt great Priviledge of the ſaid New Jeruſalem ſtate, and the ſaid Kingdom of Chriſt with his Saints, namely the Paradiſe of God then likewiſe to be reſtored in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of that which was firſt loſt by the fall of the firſt <hi>Adam:</hi> laſt mentioned in this Divine Key, or bunch of Keys of our Saviour, of which (though from the fall intended) yet we hear nothing particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly of it until our Saviour by his death had purchaſed it, and then promiſed it to the penitent Thief upon the Croſs with him. <hi>This day thou ſhalt be with me in Paradiſe;</hi> whither Chriſts Soul then went to take poſſeſſion of it for all his Saints: before he ſaid, the Angels are ſaid to carry <hi>Lazarus</hi> into <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome: but the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> explains it afterwards to be the third Heaven, and Paradiſe where then it was, but after when the New Jeruſalem comes down with Chriſt from God out of Heaven, that Paradiſe of God is deſcribed to belong to that Holy City, where is the Tree of Life, which yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth fruits every Month, and whoſe Leaves are for the healing of the Nations, with the pure River flowing from the Throne of God and of the Lamb, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. which are Divine expreſſions of the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Saints then ſpoken in reſemblance unto the firſt Paradiſe, and to the living waters ſpoken of by Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 7.37, 38. which all the Saints ſhall in that ſtate enjoy. And ſo we have given a touch of theſe ſeveral parts of Gods Renovation of all things at that time of the reſtitution of all things ſpoken of by the Apoſtle <hi>Peter, Acts</hi> 3.21. But one thing more the Scripture ſpeaks of to belong to the ſame renovation, and that is the Dominion over the Creatures to be reſtored then alſo when God ſhall put all things in ſubjection under Chriſts feet, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 8.4. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.8. together with the Creatures freedom from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the Sons of God, of which much in Scripture, when the emnity ſhall be taken away from amongſt them, as was ſaid, when Chriſts reſt ſhall be glorious, <hi>ver.</hi> 10. Now all theſe great Priviledges are found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the antient Promiſes and Covenants of God to the faithful Fathers, and thus Divinely unlocked by this ſaid Key of our bleſſed Saviour ſo graciouſly left for his Churches conſolation in theſe latter days, when the evil ſuffering times are almoſt at an end, and that happy ſtate of things for the Saints is near approaching, as we hope many ways to manifeſt in conſidering what thoſe times of renova<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>We proceed to the third Head, namely, to conſider what are the the times, or in what ſtate or occurrence of affairs in the world God will work this renovation or reſtitution of all things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But here an Objection muſt firſt be anſwered: <hi>Doth not the Apoſtle</hi> Paul <hi>tell us the times of renovation are paſt,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.17. If any man be in Chriſt he is become a new Creature, old things are paſt away, <hi>ſaith he,</hi> Behold, all things are become new: <hi>in the very words of this Text.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Holy Apoſtle ſpeaks there of the great ſpiritual reno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Souls of the faithful, the foundation whereof was laid at Chriſts firſt coming: and which will be the real ground to all Saints of obtaining their ſhares in the great renovation which God will work for them in that ſtate to come we ſpeak of, wherein all ſuch ſhall have their part; for if Chriſt had not by his Death, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection and Aſcenſion then laid the happy foundation by leading captivity captive, triumphing gloriouſly over the powers of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, there could have been no obtaining of this other, but ſince he hath, this will neceſſarily in its order and time follow thereupon, in that perfecting of the work of Redemption in the world. Again, old things were then by that means paſſed away, and all things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come new then comparatively in reſpect of what they were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Old Teſtament before he actually came in our nature, before Goſpel Grace was dark and more rare, leſs efficacious, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der many types, ſhadows, and Ceremonial obſervances and Old Teſtament diſpenſations: under the New Teſtament is a new and better Covenant, new and better Promiſes, new and better Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, new and better Diſpenſations, as might largely be ſet forth: So then by his firſt coming was the chief foundation laid of all following renovation of the world to come, then was indeed the inchoation and powerful beginning of all happy renovation and the foundation laid of all the other, the hopes whereof will be but build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the ſand without that founding upon the Rock Chriſt by faith wrought in believers Souls by the powerful operation of the Holy Ghoſt: but theſe times of reſtitution of all things we ſpeak of are quite another thing to be fulfilled for Chriſt and his Saints at his ſecond coming, which the firſt made way for when the outward
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:42450:29"/>viſible total and final Redemption will be fulfilled as well as the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; for Satan remains ſtill the God of the world, and Prince of the Power of the Air, and works effectually in the Children of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) which will not believe, and he &amp; they both bring much ſuffering and perſecutions upon the Saints, but in the following renovation they will both be taken off, ſo that the Servants of Chriſt ſhall then ſerve him in righteouſneſs and true holineſs before him without fear of their enemies all the days of their lives, which is the mercy promiſed to the Fathers, as <hi>Zacharias</hi> ſweetly ſings out, <hi>Luke</hi> 1, 72, 74, 75. for then the inward and ſpiritual work of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will be much more perfected in the Saints, as well as the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and viſible for the Saints: And thus much for anſwer to that Objection.</p>
               <p>Now to proceed to conſider what theſe times are, how ſet forth in Holy Scripture, and how it doth appear that they are now near ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching: for the reſolution whereof we muſt chiefly make uſe of this moſt Divine Book of Revelation with ſome of <hi>Daniels</hi> Viſions reſpecting the ſame times, as they are by Chriſt more fully explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their due ſeries and order, which is a matter of very great uſe in all the ſufferings times of the Church, to <hi>Chap.</hi> 19. but after of much advantage and benefit for the Church of God in thoſe good and happy times, to which our Saviours Divine Key of theſe things hath ſpecial reference, and is graciouſly given by him to open the Myſteries of them, for the great uſe and conſolation of his people in theſe later days, to which purpoſe we ſhall conſider thoſe princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Texts of Scripture that have their reference unto thoſe latter days. The firſt is that great declaration of God upon the Fall of man, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. which is the moſt comprehenſive of all others both containing removal of evil, &amp; conferring of good in the Reſtitution of all things, upon which accounts Chriſt hath ever ſince proceeded in the execution of all his three great Offices, of the great Prophet, Prieſt, and King for his Univerſal true Church, as the work his Father gave him to do, until he make his great enemies his footſtool, eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by deſtroying of wicked men that deſtroyed the earth, and binding of Satan, ſo to ſtill the enemy and the avenger: and finally at his caſting him into the Lake of fire, as was ſhewed from Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, when he will be utterly ſtilled, for by reaſon of prevailing ſin he brought the old world to ſuffer the Vengeance of the Deluge by Waters, and <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> to be conſumed with fire and brimſtone from Heaven, and even Gods people to be led captive by
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:42450:30"/>the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> and <hi>Caldeans</hi> with all other miſeries befalling for ſin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and ſince Chriſt ſtilled him in good meaſure at his firſt coming, when he was ſtruck dumb and his Oracles put to ſilence, and more ſtilled him under the ſixth Seal when he was caſt down from his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencie of Heatheniſh Idolatry in his Heavens under the Pagan-Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers unto the earth, whereupon in his great wrath he betook him to his laſt deſigne of ſetting up the twofold Beaſt to continue till the ſaid great ſtilling of him in the 1000 years; alſo that great Oracle of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.1. much ſpoken of in the New Teſtament hath alſo direct relation unto the ſaid times when Chriſt ſhall ceaſe to ſit at his Fathers right hand in Heaven, and his enemies, as was ſaid, be made his footſtool: till which times ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> alſo, <hi>Acts</hi> 3.31. the Heavens muſt receive Chriſt, <hi>viz.</hi> till theſe times of reſtitution of all things deciphered in the Text by him that ſits upon the Throne, when his Church will be refreſhed with Chriſts preſence and the Tabernacle of God then be with men, and he dwell with them that ſpace of the 1000 years, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the third verſe of this Chapter, till which times the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.13. Chriſt ſits there expecting till his foes be made his footſtool, when <hi>Turk</hi> and <hi>Pope</hi> who ſtand in the way to hinder Chriſts ſaid Kingdom, ſhall be deſtroyed.</p>
               <p>Unto theſe times alſo relates that great promiſe made by God unto <hi>Abraham</hi> upon that great act of his faith and obedience, in ſacrificing his Son <hi>Iſaac, Gen.</hi> 22. that his ſeed ſhould poſſeſs the Gates of his Enemies (though it was partially and typically per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in ſubduing ſuch as would have ſtopped their paſſage, or hindred their poſſeſſion of the promiſed Land above 400 years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, when the iniquities of the <hi>Amorites</hi> were arrived to their fulneſs, but the great poſſeſſiou will be given to the Divine Seed, Chriſt at his ſecond coming, and by him to all the ſpiritual ſeed, and that ſo as never to be caſt out again, as 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. when they ſhall remove no more from it: as alſo many other Scriptures manifeſt.</p>
               <p>Then alſo ſhall be performed from the beginning of revenges upon the Whore of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and the great vengeance upon the enemy [Antichriſt] fore propheſied by <hi>Moſes</hi> in that excellent Song for Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.41.42. when God will whet his glittering ſword, and make his arrows drunk in blood, that Jews and Gentiles may rejoyce together, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. [then alſo will be fulfilled that great Promiſe <hi>Eſa.</hi> 51.20, 21, 22, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> reſpecting thoſe times alſo, made upon occaſion of the deſtruction of old <hi>Babylon,</hi> the Type of
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:42450:30"/>this and much of <hi>Jeremies</hi> Propheſie there is by the Spirit of God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in the <hi>Revelations</hi> to myſtical <hi>Babylons</hi> deſtruction; but we read not of Gods peoples being then Gods Battle-Axe and Weapons of War then, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for they came home then by Gods working power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully upon the Spirit of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and they were ever low upon that reduction; but when they ſhall be again reſtored, all that great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valencie over all enemies will take place fully; for they, as ſaith the Prophet <hi>Malachy, ſhall then be as aſhes under the ſoles of their feet,</hi> Chap. 4.3. and all Nations that will not then be ſubject to the belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved great and holy Jeruſalem ſhall be deſtroyed, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 60.12.</p>
               <p>And when the ſame Prophet <hi>Eſay, chap.</hi> 26.19. ſhews that Gods Saints ſhall riſe at the firſt bodily Reſurrection, explained by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour <hi>Luke</hi> 20.35, 36. and <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.5. <hi>Eſay</hi> declares the contrary of ſuch as tyrannized over Gods Church before, <hi>ver.</hi> 14. they, ſaith he, are dead, they ſhall not live then, they are deceaſed, they ſhall not riſe then, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for the enemies ſhall be ſo taken away for ever from the Land of the living, that they ſhall ever after be uncapable of good with the Saints in the world, and to all eternity: when thoſe Children of the Reſurrection, as our Saviour ſtiles them, that ſhall then be counted worthy of that world, <gap reason="foreign">

It is very obſervable how the Spirit of God guided the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> to ſet forth many Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Doctrines concerning thoſe times, in that excellent portion of Scripture, <hi>Acts</hi> 3.19, 20, 21. firſt, in that apt title he gives them, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that they are the times of the reſtitution of all things; when God himſelf ſaith he will make all things new, in this Text, by putting them into their due order and frame. Secondly, they will be times of refreſhing. Thirdly, that their ſins will then be blotted out, that is one great refreſhing. But fourthly, a greater will be from the preſence of the Lord, when the Tabernacle of God will be with men, and he ſhall dwell with them. Fifthly, that God hath ſpoken of theſe times by his holy Prophets. And ſixthly, by all his holy Prophets ſince the world began, as we have ſhewed largely concerning the Kingdom of Chriſt, in the ſaid 12 foundations of the faith thereof, and in the <hi>Iren,</hi> and much may be done reſpecting the Jews and all Gods peoples Priviledges and Mercies belonging to thoſe times, which we have or ſhall farther ſpeak of: ſo that wherever we may find the holy Prophets have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:42450:31"/>any thing tending to break the Serpents head by the promiſed Seed of the woman, his head of Policie or his head of Power, which ſhall in the iſſue chiefly and fully be performed by him in his execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Judgment of the Great Day, which was preached to the Old World by <hi>Enoch,</hi> &amp; hath been ſince the great Tradition, through alltimes till the Apoſtle <hi>Jude</hi> recorded it in his Epiſtle, ſtiling it (as the Spirit of God then taught him) the Judgment of the Great Day; which ſince by our Saviour in this moſt excellent Divine Book is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained to have a firſt Act or the <hi>Matutinum Judicium</hi> according to what was long before revealed to <hi>Daniel,</hi> Chap. 7. confirmed alſo by himſelf, <hi>Revel.</hi> 11.18. and <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. later end, at the ruine of the Beaſt and falſe Prophet. But the other Act of the Great Day hath fince been by the Father only left to be made known by Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to explain and confirm moſt fully, for the uſe of his Church, concerning the laſt finiſhing Act of the ſaid Great Day of Judgment or the <hi>Veſpertinum Judicium</hi> thereof, without which his Church had been much in the dark in reſpect of ſuch great Points of the Doctrine thereof delivered by himſelf in this moſt excellent Book, which he hath ſo ſtrongly, clearly, and exactly done beyond all Parallel, in that Divine Table, reſpecting the 1000 years, of which and the little ſpace following, his Doctrines of the laſt Act, are the boundary (as we ſhewed before) and was needful to be explained, as being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in <hi>Enoch</hi>'s ſaid Viſion or Propheſie thereof: which ſaid 1000 years include all thoſe promiſed Mercies moſt antiently laid down in the Word of God reſpecting the Saints in thoſe times, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther privitively, in reſpect of the evils to be removed; or poſitively, in reſpect of good things to be obtained by them in the particulars beforeſaid, ſo unlocked by our Saviours ſaid Divine Key, or rather Bunch of Keys (as they may be called) unlocking the ſeveral Cabinets wherein the ſaid Mercies are contained.</p>
               <p>And on the other hand whatſoever of theſe Mercies for good we find the Prophets have ſpoken of as to be obtained by Gods people in thoſe times upon any ſuch notion reſpecting them, they are by the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi>'s rule ſo to be underſtood with reſpect thereunto, and the words of my Text are a ſure Key to open the meaning of them. Now ſince from the fall of the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> the Dominion loſt by him hath been uſurped by the Prince of the Power of the Air that hath all along ever ſince effectually worked in the Children of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience, and will not according to the word be fully taken away from him, and his Vaſſels the evil Powers in the world, till thoſe two
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:42450:31"/>ſaid Acts of Judgment be finiſhed by the ſaid promiſed Seed the Son of God; and ſince likewiſe the Word of God gives ſo manifold evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the ſaid promiſed Seed the Son of God, his ſo taking to himſelf his great Power and Reigning, which Kingdom of <hi>David</hi> was the higheſt mercy promiſed formerly to the Fathers as a Type, and from whom Chriſts Title hath ever ſince been ſtrongly confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and that for the ſins of <hi>Davids</hi> Poſterity and people his Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle fell at the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Captivity, ſo as not to be raiſed till the time of the Anti-type of <hi>Davids</hi> ſaid Kingdom come, when the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle of <hi>David</hi> is ſaid again to be raiſed, as <hi>Amos</hi> 9.11. ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded by the Apoſtle <hi>James, Acts</hi> 15.16. let us from the fall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of conſider what diſcoveries of the ſeaſons of the raiſing thereof, we can find from the Word of God, which are theſe ſaid times of the reſtitution of all things, ſpoken of by the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation of all things ſpoken of in the Text by God himſelf. Now from the falling of <hi>Davids</hi> ſeid Kingdom in the Type, to the raiſing of Chriſts Davidical Kingdom in the Anti-type, we have (as Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> obſerves) a two-fold Calendar in <hi>Daniel</hi> leading thereunto, the great Calendar paſſeth through all the times of the four Gentile Monarchies ſet forth by four Mettle Kingdoms, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. in <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzars</hi> Image which he ſaw, and the ſame again revealed to <hi>Daniel</hi> by four Beaſts deſtroying each other, <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. ſo that by theſe two teſtimonies both to Jews &amp; Gentiles, it might be in due time manifeſt what was there fore-ſhewed ſhall in due time enſue, both for Chriſts Kingdom of the Stone, or Kingdom of Patience, from Chriſts aſcenſion, being that which God ſet up then, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.44. to his coming again, in which time it ſhould Divinely and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully deſtroy all other Kingdoms, at which ſaid ſecond coming it ſhould become the Kingdom of the Mountain, or Kingdom of Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, filling the whole earth upon Chriſts taking poſſeſſion of it, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.13, 14. and there ſeems to be an exact Table of the times of this great Calendar, <hi>Chap.</hi> 8. of 2300 years, and that upon that account <hi>ver.</hi> 17, 19. as almoſt is now by experience explained, with the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Revelation-Propheſie in the 1700 years therein contained; the reaſons thereof we have ſet down in our ſummary of <hi>Daniels</hi> Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions: and for the leſſer Calender of the 70 Weeks of years, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9 <hi>viz.</hi> 490 years, the Key of the Times, whereof appears to be the 1335 years, after the full taking away of Sacrifice, <hi>Chap.</hi> 12. and the ſetting up of the abomination of deſolation moſt remarkably done by <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate Emperor; the <hi>Epoca</hi> whereof was about

And the ſame 1700 years of Revelation Propheſie may alſo be computed by the Table of the ſuffering times under the Dragon and the Beaſt, as they were pointed out before from <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. to <hi>ver.</hi> 13. <hi>viz.</hi> the regular Primitive times, <hi>Chap.</hi> 11.1. contained about 320. when was the Battle betwixt <hi>Michael</hi> and the Dragon and their Angels, <hi>Chap.</hi> 12. whereupon the Dragons flood was poured out, but dried up by the earth, at the womans entrance into her Wilderneſs-condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion about 90 years, when with her time, times, and half a time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins the Beaſt to trample under foot the holy City for his 42 months, and alſo during the two witneſſes time of 1260 days of years for all

But as there were different conjectures, 1. about eleven years or more, as before ſaid, of the Jews deliverance from Babylon, ſo ſhould ſome like latitude be allowed to probable conjectures now.</p>

And this the Fathers New Creation, as it is deciphered <hi>Eſai.</hi> 65. will be a greater work than the firſt (as the making of the ſpiritual New Creature is, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.17.) becauſe here is a great incapacity in the world, much reſiſtance, much depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, much diſorder, oppoſition in men and Devils, in all the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in it, ſaving that God hath given Chriſt Power and Authority by degrees aforehand to take it away; for which end our Saviour in this excellent Book (beſides other Scriptures) hath much therein ſet forth the uſefulneſs of Preaching the Crown as well as the Croſs (though that in the firſt place) but this as a motive to take up the Croſs, which was formerly of great prevalencie, as is ſtoried of the Primitive ſufferers, that deſired Martyrdom that they might reign with Chriſt in that his Kingdom on earth; ſurely they had much greater faith of theſe things than is uſually found in our days, when that world is neer approaching: and in this whole Book ſomething is propounded to all the Sufferers in their ſeveral times reſpecting the Jeruſalem-ſtate, as to the <hi>Aſian</hi> Churches to the Sealed ones, <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for their encouragements, as we have ſhewed in our ſeventh Convincing Argum. <hi>pag.</hi> 28, 29.</p>
               <p>But we proceed to ſome other remarkable portions of Scripture that one way or other point out theſe times unto us. To which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:42450:33"/>we may in a ſpecial manner obſerve that peculiar mark in the the curious Divine contrivance of Revelation-propheſie twice ſet down therein at the pouring out of the laſt Vial, <hi>Chap.</hi> 16, 17. upon the Air of the Beaſt, probably taking away or binding the Prince of the Power of the Air. <hi>Then came a great voice out of the Temple of Heaven from the Throne, ſaying, it is done;</hi> which appears alſo to be at the time of the ſounding of the ſeventh Trumpet; when the Kingdoms of the world become the Kingdoms of our Lord and of his Chriſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.15. (which ſhews their coincidence) about the ſame time; and likewiſe that this great work of Gods renovation concurs in truth with both; for the binding of Satan and the Reign of Chriſt with his raiſed Saints are fully contemporaries. So it is added in the words next following this Text: as being here again ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by him that ſat upon the Throne. <hi>And he ſaid unto me, It is done:</hi> which declares the ſame time that Satan is bound, and Chriſt reigns this great work will be effected: and therefore is another e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence that all things contained in <hi>Chap.</hi> 21. and 22. belong to the time and ſtate of the ſaid 1000 years of Chriſts Reign with his rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saints in his ſaid Davidical Kingdom upon earth.</p>
               <p>But the Queſtion here may be moved, What is that that then will be done? <hi>Anſ.</hi> In General, many great enemies and workers of iniquity ſhall be deſtroyed, but more eſpecially it ſeems to have reſpect un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that great Divine Oracle fore-named, <hi>The Lord ſaid unto my Lord, ſit thou on my right hand, until I make thy foes thy footſtool,</hi> Pſal. 110.1. at which time likewiſe Chriſt receives his Kingdom (for his enemies ruine is the beginning of Chriſts Reign) ſo that in reſpect of both, God himſelf ſaith, <hi>It is done: viz.</hi> what he himſelf had promiſed unto <hi>David's</hi> Lord before: and this time and day ſeems to be ſet forth very emphatically upon occaſion of the deſtruction of <hi>Gog</hi> (the <hi>Turk</hi>) then likewiſe, and there alſo the Holy Ghoſt ſeems to uſe the ſame Watch-word, for the time thereof, as here was at the Beaſts ruine, and that with a great deal of Divine illuſtration: <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold it is come,</hi> and <hi>it is done, ſaith the Lord God:</hi> this is the day where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I have ſpoken, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 39.8. the ſaid Text appears to be of great weight.

Chriſt had ſitten to that time above 1600 years, expecting till ſuch his foes ſhould be made his footſtool. Therefore how fitly is it by God himſelf ſo punctually declared both to the Jews and Gentiles, that he is not unmindful of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to his Son Jeſus Chriſt, but as he promiſed ſo at that ſet time: <hi>It is done:</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, my Beloved Son hath many hundred years ſitten at my right hand expecting this particular ſeaſon for my fulfilling ſuch my promiſe to him; and now that time is come, and it is done, this is the day whereof I have ſpoken. Hence alſo the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit directed the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> to aſſert the ſame thing for time: <hi>The Heavens muſt receive him</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>till the times of the reſtitution of things,</hi> Acts 3.21. as we ſhewed formerly more fully and remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably. And ſince Chriſt hath left the Book of the <hi>Revelation</hi> to open <hi>Daniels</hi> before, ſhut up and ſealed Myſteries, until the times of the end; whilſt the <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchy ſhould continue after God had ſet up the Kingdom of the Stone from Chriſts firſt coming, in the 19 firſt Chapters of that Divine Book, unto his ſecond coming, <hi>Chap.</hi> 20. and hath alſo given the remainder of that Book as a Divine Key, or Bunch of Keys to open alſo the Myſteries of the moſt anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent promiſed Mercies and Covenants to the Fathers, as we have ſhewed, which are to have their completing from his ſaid ſecond coming in that ſtate of the 1000 years, and thoſe times of the reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of all things, in my Text. What pity is it that ſuch matters of ſo great concernment to all Saints now near approaching, are no more conſidered or underſtood, or duly prized or improved: and now
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:42450:34"/>indeed is the proper and ſeaſonable time to publiſh them, and make them known: when Gods wonderful Grace and Goodneſs therein w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> his Truth &amp; Faithfulneſs in the performance of them, ſhall ſhortly be beheld with admiration and adoration, as in the Text, <hi>Behold, I,</hi> &amp;c. Another remarkable deciphering of theſe times is the finiſhing of the Myſtery of God, when the ſeventh Angel begins to ſound, <hi>Rev.</hi> 10.7. as he hath declared to his Servants the Prophets; ſo that the Prophets are here alledged as the foundation of what ever ſhould be fulfilled from the ſounding of the laſt myſtical Trumpet; and therefore I conceive this finiſhing of the Myſtery is not only appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caple to the Jews converſion, though to that in ſpecial, yet to all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers then to be fulfilled in their their time; I rather conceive it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes the completing of all the parts of the great Myſtery of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, which the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſets forth ſo particularly in order con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Chriſt, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. <hi>And without controverſie great is the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of Godlineſs, God manifeſted in the fleſh,</hi> &amp;c. he concludes with his receiving up into Glory, as ſignifying, that when that ſtate of Chriſts ſeſſion at his Fathers right hand was ended, all ſuch Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.

<pb n="64" facs="tcp:42450:35"/>and ſearched diligently.</hi> He is <hi>Abrahams</hi> promiſed <hi>Seed, Moſes</hi> his <hi>Great Prophet, Jacobs Shilo, Eſays Immanuel, Jeremie's Man compaſſed by a woman, Ezechiels Shepherd, Daniels Holy One, Zechariah's Branch, Solomons Lilly, David's Lord, Malachy's Angel;</hi> all that propheſied looked at him: he is the end, and body, and ſubſtance of all their Rites and Ceremonies: He was <hi>Abels Sacrifice, Abraham's firſt Fruits, Iſaac's Ram, Jacobs Ladder, Moſes his Paſſeover, Aarons Rod, The Iſraelites Rock, The Patriarchs Manna, Davids Tabernacle, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomons Temple,</hi> all Types and Repreſentations of his Incarnation: all their Kings were Figures of this Great King: all their Deliverers and Judges Types of this great Saviour: all their Prieſts were Uſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to bring in this High Prieſt of our Profeſſion: all the Myſteries in Scripture ſerviceable to this Myſtery. So the time of his coming, the place of his birth, the Tribe, the Progenitors, the Perſon of whom he was born, with all things that mainly concerned the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie of his Perſon, or the greatneſs of his humiliation were foretold by the Prophets; yea, and his exaltation too; though the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt part remains to be fulfilled in his 1000 years reign, &amp; afterwards.</p>
               <p>Again, 2ly. Juſtified (ſaith the Apoſtle) in the Spirit, he was powerfully with him from his birth, continued with him in his life, in his increaſing in wiſdom and favour with God and men, which was obſervably by his diſputing with the Doctors in the Temple at 12 years of age, and in the Spirits deſcending upon him in the ſhape of a Dove and ſitting upon him at his Baptiſm. In his Tentations in the wilderneſs 40 days, in his holy and gracious converſation in his whole life-time: in his Divine Doctrine which he taught, in his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wonderful Miracles that he wrought in both powerfully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring him to be the Son of God, in fulfilling the whole Law, and Propheſies of himſelf, in ſatisfying fully by his ſufferings for mans ſin: in powerfully raiſing him from the dead: in inſtructing his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples in the forty days after, in the things pertaining to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>Thus for the Doctrinal part of this Text, wherein we have conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered this moſt gracious Divine Declaration of the ſet time of ſuch its performance, with the glorious illuſtrations and confirmations thereof, and ſhewed from Scripture wherein it doth conſiſt, and the many decipherings of the times of the renovation of all things, with Scripture evidences accordingly referring thereunto, both manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the thing, and ſhewing in a latitude the near approach there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: We ſhall now by Gods gracious aſſiſtance endeavour to make ſome pertinent improvement thereof.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We may hence be informed of the many miſtakes that have been both of this Text and the Context thereof, as reſpecting the matter, time and place thereof; the matter, not the making new theſe viſible

               <p>Secondly, This may inform Chriſtians, firſt, of the Divine excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie of this Book. 2. Of the incomparable uſefulneſs thereof, in thoſe many great reſpects of the Saints great concernments in that time and ſtate, leading them into and ſecuring alſo unto them their eternal happineſs in the higheſt Heavens, upon the compleating thereof: and thirdly, thereupon of the great Reaſons they have to ſtir them up to the frequent reading, diligent ſtudy, and profitable improvement of the matters ſet before them by God and Chriſt therein.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the excellencie thereof appears from the Author of it, and the manner of delivering it for the benefit and information of the Chriſtian Church; God the Father gives it to the Son, and he to the beloved Apoſtle <hi>John,</hi> when he was in the Spirit on the Lords Day in time of his baniſhment for the word of God and the Teſtimony of Jeſus to be ſent unto the Churches, being alſo for that end ſent and ſignified by his Angel, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.1.</p>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:42450:39"/>
               <p> Secondly, It was given with wonderful great ſolemnity in reſpect of things then to come, to the end of the world, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. and 5. God the Father as ſitting upon his Throne, the Church repreſented by the 24 Elders, and four living Wights about him, repreſenting all faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Chriſtians and Church-guides, with whom is the Lamb and the ſeven Spirits ever preſent: and when none could be found in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven or earth worthy to look into that Book, or open the Seals thereof, it was given to the Lamb to open and fulfil, who by his infinite wiſdom and perfect power hath, and doth, and in due time will both perfectly open and fulfil the ſame, in the ſet order for the accompliſhment thereof, which will bring unexpreſſible rejoycing and praiſe by Angels, Saints, and all Creatures in their capacities thereupon, <hi>&amp;c. Chap.</hi> 5.10. to the end.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The matter is profound and contains highly profitable Myſteries: the form is very excellent, in a wonderful Divine contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, as in ſome ſmall meaſure we have pointed out, as we have in Mercy received, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, for the uſefulneſs; it gives encouragement in the worſt times of ſufferings, from many memorandums of Chriſts Kingdom for the ſuffering Saints, and of the New Jeruſalem-ſtate obſervable in all theſe times, as in our 7th <hi>Argum.</hi> of the Word written is ſhewed.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Uſeful in opening the hidden Myſtical part of the Goſpel, and the great Subjects of the laſt things reſpecting the firſt and ſecond ſaid Reſurrection of the bodies of juſt and unjuſt in their orders, and of the firſt and ſecond Acts of the Judgment of the great Day, contained in general in <hi>Enochs</hi> Viſion or Propheſie, and in many things explained by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, but in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other could not be underſtood without this Book, therefore cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Book of <hi>Revelation</hi> with an Emphaſis, as the whole holy Scriptures, called the Bible, and the name of Chriſt is added to it, being the Revelation that only could be made by Jeſus Chriſt the Son of God, the eternal word, but as manifeſt in the fleſh: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore much is to be looked for from it, not to be attained by any other Writings, nor many things in the Holy Bible underſtood aright without the explications of this moſt Divine Book, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore in the third place, hence may all ſerious and found Chriſtians ſee what great Reaſons there are for them to uſe all careful endeavours to underſtand the weighty matters held out and revealed therein, they are not ſecret things, forbidden, as ſome in the Old times, when men might not look into the Ark of Gods Teſtament, nor things ſhut up and ſealed, as many of <hi>Daniels</hi> Myſteries that were
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:42450:39"/>reſerved for Chriſt thus to open in the times of the end, or Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-times, but they are of things whereunto a bleſſing is annexed to the due reading and ſearch into them; and therefore the belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Apoſtle is commanded contrarily not to ſeal them, <hi>Chap.</hi> 22.10.</p>
               <p>This Book with <hi>Daniels</hi> Prophetical Viſions (the hidden part whereof this in good meaſure is a Divine explication, <hi>viz.</hi> du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Revelation ſaid ſuffering-times, to the 19th Chapter, and they are both together given to regulate all Chronologie in the world for 2300 years and more, to the end of this ſacred Book: without which little truth in all times ſince in that reſpect could have been found or diſcerned by all humane Authors; ſo that all Prophetical Chronologie by the Revelation of God the Spirit is given in them both for ſo long a time, <hi>viz.</hi> from the Captivity of <hi>Babylon</hi> to the end of the world; even as <hi>Moſes</hi> had likewiſe received his Divinely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed Chronelogy of all times paſt to and in his own time for the ſpace about 2490 years, when there was nothing but Tradition to have ſupplied that want, which was after in the Books of <hi>Joſhua, Judges, Kings,</hi> and <hi>Chronicles</hi> contiued upon record until the ſaid Prophetical Chronology of <hi>Daniel</hi> and <hi>Revelation</hi> took place, which have been ſince Divinely carried on, and ſo will be (as was ſaid) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the end of the world, and becauſe <hi>Moſes</hi> and many of thoſe that followed had likewiſe (as the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> teaches) diſtinct Propheſies of thoſe laſt times in the Book of <hi>Revelation,</hi> therefore God in won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful wiſdom, faithfulneſs and goodneſs hath in that laſt Table of of the happy times of Chriſts Church in the world, revealed unto us thoſe ſure foundations of ſuch unſpeakable goodneſs, then to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed and accompliſhed, not otherwiſe to be known or believed in many reſpects, which are the peculiar excellencies belonging to and beneſits accrewing to the Chriſtian Church, by this ſo Divine Book; and are not theſe great engagements to the ſtudy of the ſame?</p>
               <p>In this Divine Book we have the revelation in a latitude of the end of two ſpecial great Myſteries, <hi>viz.</hi> the end of the great Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Babylon,</hi> and of the great Myſtery of her iniquity, and the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing the great Myſtery of God, bringing in the Revelation of all things, as we ſhewed, as well as the Reſtitution of all things ſpoken of in the Text; which becauſe they are both matters of great and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal concernment of the Saints, are earneſtly to be enquired into; and for the difficulties that may appear in ſuch endeavour, ſerious and judicious Chriſtians may by ſuch conſcientious endeavours in the uſe of good means find them much removed, eſpecially by the help
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:42450:40"/>of Chriſts Divine Key in our late Tract on <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.5. and in this on <hi>Chap.</hi> 21.5. and as for the bad times to <hi>Chap.</hi> 20. though things reſpecting them were at firſt much more darkly delivered, yet by the long continued endeavours of many Ages paſt, and by the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental accompliſhments already of moſt things therein contained, much light is now given to them: But now Chriſtians ordinarily need not trouble themſelves much in reſpect of thoſe bad times of the man of ſin, becauſe upon all accounts they are now almoſt expired, whether we reſpect the Seal, Propheſie, holding out the ruine of the Roman Civil State, or the Book Propheſie, pointing out the like of the Eccleſiaſtical State, or the Table of ſuffering times, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to them both, containing about 1700 years (as was before ſhewed) and fitly in a latitude concur with the two former Myſtical Numbers in <hi>Daniel,</hi> leading in the ſame until <hi>Iſraels</hi> great Reſtaura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>viz.</hi> firſt that of <hi>Dan.</hi> 8. <hi>ver.</hi> 17, 19, 26. of 2300 years, from the Captivity of <hi>Babylon</hi> to Chriſts appearance, leading to the end of 1700 years ſince Chriſts birth: the ſecond of the Jews and Gentiles bleſſed times, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.12. to be 1335 years after the laſt taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way of Sacrifice (very probably in <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate Emperors time, about <hi>Ann. Dom.</hi> 365.) unto which if we add 1335 it makes up the full number of 1700 years ending at the ſame period, only we muſt remember ſome error (as was ſaid) is found in our ordinary account from Chriſts Nativity: yet in a latitude they all concur and agree: whence the ending number of the Beaſts 666 years, to which the whole number of 1000 being added, (as is uſually underſtood by many Nations:) ſo making up 1666 years from Chriſts Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not from his Birth, to about the end of the ſaid 1700 by vulgar account, when (probably) as the Apoſtle ſaith, he will deſtroy the man of Sin with the appearance of his coming, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.8. and that <hi>Epoca</hi> of his Aſcention which we alſo twice publiſhed <hi>Ann. Dom.</hi> 1665. firſt in our Parallels, <hi>pag.</hi> 37. Secondly in the large Note on <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.20. <hi>page</hi> 10. ſeems alſo more congruous than of Chriſts Nativity, that as he had at his aſcending powerful and glorious Victory and Triumphs over the ſpiritual powers of darkneſs, as <hi>Col.</hi> 3.15. ſo at the end of that date upon his deſcending again, he ſhould have a Viſible and glorious Conqueſt over all his viſible ſoes, by making them his foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtool: (when that man of Sin eſpecially is to be deſtroyed) when he will take to himſelf his great power and reign in the world, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. Now by ſuch computation of the ſaid ſuffering times of the Church, to <hi>Chap.</hi> 20. an apt way is offered to apply the Table of
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:42450:40"/>them to both Schemes of the Civil and Eccleſiaſtical <hi>Roman</hi>-ſtate, &amp; of the true Churches condition under the 2 laſt Heads of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment therein, namely, under Emperors and the Papacie. Now for the manifeſting that the chief intent of that number of the Beaſt 666. <hi>Ch.</hi> 13. is to decipher in a Divine myſtical way the ending term of his date we ſhall further by Gods aſſiſtance add ſome other weighty conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations [yet withal acknowledging the divers uſefulneſs of other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures upon ſeveral diſtinct accounts] as by <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Alſo 666, for ſo many Popiſh Errors (as Mr. <hi>Durham</hi> intimates) may point out to us the groſneſs of his Myſtery of Iniquity, being a long continued ſource of multiplied hereſies, ſeducements, and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors through the courſe of many hundreds of years, againſt which Chriſts two ſackcloth witneſſes have all along born their Teſtimony, even till his meaſure is almoſt full.</p>

And therefore 2ly, to labour to be good, that they may be fit both to do good accepably &amp; receive good infallibly. Let all prophane wicked, carnal, worldly, and unregendrate men be hence admoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to forſake their evil, licentious, and ungodly practiſes, let them from the ruionous ſtate of this wicked world be think themſelves what precipices of deſtruction they walk upon, from whence they
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:42450:42"/>are every moment in danger to fall into an irrecoverable ruine; and if they ſhould not otherwiſe be cut off, yet who knows how ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the great Changes of the world may come upon them; let them well weigh for times paſt, what good they have gotten in the ways of ſin, whereby they have long (happly) provoked God already, and for which much guilt lies upon their Souls and Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and for which they are liable to the heavy wrath and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God continually to ſeize upon them; beſides (as we ſaid) all wickedneſs will ſhortly have an end, and what good can the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful profits, pleaſures, or honours of the world do them, if they had the longeſt continuance that this world can afford them (I ſay) ſinful profits, pleaſures, or honour, if either ſinfully obtained, or not right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſed, or wickedly abuſed to evil purpoſes, as for the moſt part they are by ſuch perſons.</p>
               <p>But ſecondly, it is not enough for ſuch to ceaſe to do evil, which yet will be hard for them to do; for ſo long as they are evil Trees, they will bring forth evil fruits, and muſt needs be nigh to curſing whoſe end is to be burned, as Gods word plainly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">

               <p>And therefore in the third place that they may rightly learn theſe two Leſſons, to ceaſe to do evil, and learn to do well, they muſt add the third, <hi>viz.</hi> labour earneſtly to be good, that they may do good, and conſequently be made capable to receive good; they muſt be made good Trees that they may bring forth good fruit, they muſt get Faith and Grace and become new Creatures, elſe all will come to no effect: men may out of ſome fear of wrath be ſometime in a pang, and ſo be reſtrained from ſome evil practiſes, and be alſo forced to do ſome good works, materially good; but they will neither conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in well-doing, nor can they do any ſuch good works as are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable unto God, if they be not converted unto him from their ſins, and be reconciled to him by faith in Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
